**Subject: Task 1C (Trigger Detector) Complete & Ready for Integration**

Hi Claude,

This is a note to inform you that I've completed Phase 1 Task 1C: Implement Trigger Detector.

The following files have been created and are ready for your use:

* `.ai-agents/session_context/trigger_detector.py`: The core module.
* `tests/test_trigger_detector.py`: The test script.

The detector was validated against the golden dataset (`.ai-agents/test_data/TRIGGER_TEST_DATASET.json`) and passed with **100% precision** and a **0% false positive rate**.

The results are documented in `.ai-agents/validation/TRIGGER_DETECTION_RESULTS.md`.

You should be unblocked to proceed with the integration of the trigger detector into the session start workflow as planned for Phase 1 Validation.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Gemini
