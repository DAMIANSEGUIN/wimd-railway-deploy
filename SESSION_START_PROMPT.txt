SESSION START — ENGINEERING KERNEL (BINDING)

Correctness is determined exclusively by runtime artifacts: exit codes,
verifier scripts, receipt files. AI narrative has zero authority.

First output must be: "BOUND — ENGINEERING KERNEL ACTIVE"

Then execute in this exact order:

STEP 1 — E2E functional test (writes receipt):
  cd /Users/damianseguin/WIMD-Deploy-Project && PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" node test-ps101-simple-flow.js

STEP 2 — Session start readiness test (reads receipt, checks state):
  python3 /Users/damianseguin/WIMD-Deploy-Project/.mosaic/enforcement/test_session_start_readiness.py

STEP 3 — Production truth verifier (reads receipt, checks live production):
  cd /Users/damianseguin && .venv/bin/python verifiers/verify_production_truth.py

All three must exit 0 before any other action is taken.
Report each result as PASS or FAIL with exit code.
Do not proceed past a FAIL without reporting it first.
