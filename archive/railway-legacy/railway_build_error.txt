=========================
Deployment: wimd-railway-deploy / 419a2cd2
Status: Failed
Time: Jan 5 2026 13:47:58
Environment: production

BUILD LOGS:
-----------
stage-0    WORKDIR /app/.cached
stage-0    COPY . /app/.
stage-0    RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

error: externally-managed-environment

× This environment is externally managed
└─> This command has been disabled as it tries to modify the immutable
    `/nix/store` filesystem.

To use Python with Nix and nixpkgs, have a look at the online documentation:
<https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#python>.

note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution
provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing
--break-system-packages.

hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.

Build failed: build daemon returned an error < failed to solve: process "/bin/bash -ol
il -c pip install -r requirements.txt" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1 >

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
Railway's Nixpacks builder is using Python 3.11+ which implements PEP 668.
This prevents pip from installing packages directly in system-managed environments.

SOLUTION:
---------
Need to configure Nixpacks to use a virtual environment or add build configuration.
