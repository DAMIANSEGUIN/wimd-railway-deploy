# Note for Claude_Code — 2025-11-09

## What changed

- Implemented the guarded `safeInitApp` bootstrap (with diagnostics and user-facing failover) in both `mosaic_ui/index.html` and `frontend/index.html`. Expect the console breadcrumb sequence documented in `CLAUDE_AI_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`.
- Added execution checkpoints inside the IIFE so we can see whether the parser reaches the `initApp` definition before wiring the listener.
- Reworked the deployment toolchain:
  - `scripts/deploy_frontend_netlify.sh` now stages a temporary copy, stamps `BUILD_ID` there, deploys it, and discards the artefact. The repository stays clean.
  - `Mosaic/PS101_Continuity_Kit/inject_build_id.js` accepts `BUILD_ID_TARGET_ROOT`/`BUILD_ID_TARGETS` overrides so we can point it at the staging copy.
  - `scripts/deploy.sh` still exports `BUILD_ID`/`SPEC_SHA`, but only checks readiness; it no longer mutates tracked HTML.
- Updated `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` to reflect the new stamping workflow and to call out the post-deploy `git status` check.
- Follow-up (current session): hardened chat/auth wiring so the “first visit” nudge and chat helpers only run after Phase 2.5 initializes DOM references. `chat`, `chatLog`, `chatInput`, and `sendMsg` now live at module scope with a `chatGuard` helper (which lazily rebinds DOM nodes if init hasn’t wired them yet), and the nudge block moved inside `initApp`. Mirrors applied to both HTML entry points.

## Verification already run

- `./scripts/verify_critical_features.sh` ✅ (warnings about API_BASE / prod auth unchanged)
- `./Mosaic/PS101_Continuity_Kit/check_spec_hash.sh` ✅ (`7795ae25`)
- No deployment executed yet; tree currently has uncommitted working changes and long-standing untracked assets (see `git status`).

## What to do next

1. Review the updated `mosaic_ui/index.html` / `frontend/index.html` sections (search for `INIT SETUP` logs) and ensure we’re comfortable with the UX around a failed init.
2. When ready to ship, run `./scripts/deploy.sh netlify`. The wrapper will:
   - Run the verification gate first,
   - Copy the publish dir into a temp folder,
   - Stamp `BUILD_ID` inside that folder,
   - Deploy to Netlify without dirtying the repo.
3. After deploy finishes, run `git status --short` to confirm we stayed clean, then follow the checklist to log results and verify the live footer (`curl https://whatismydelta.com | grep BUILD_ID`).
4. Post-deploy verification (browser): open DevTools before refresh and confirm
   - `[INIT] Phase 2.5 chat readiness` reports all `true`
   - `[INIT SETUP] DOM ...` logs fire exactly once
   - Login CTA shows (button `#showAuthModal` visible when logged-out)
   - Chat send/response succeeds (watch Network tab for `/wimd` POST)
   Document console + network findings in the active Stage 2/3 files.
