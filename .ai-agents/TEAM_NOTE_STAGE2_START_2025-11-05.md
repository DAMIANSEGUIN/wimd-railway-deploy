# Team Note – Stage 2 Action Plan Ready

**Date:** 2025-11-05
**From:** Cursor (Team Coordinator)
**To:** All Team Members
**Status:** ✅ Ready for execution

---

## Summary

Stage 2 instructions are now documented and ready for team execution:

**📋 Action Plan:** `.ai-agents/STAGE2_ACTION_PLAN_2025-11-05.md`

---

## Assignments

✅ **Cursor** – Live DevTools Capture

- Capture production DevTools evidence (console logs, network activity, state inspection)
- Document findings in `.ai-agents/STAGE2_DIAGNOSIS_2025-11-05.md`
- Include screenshots/logs for all diagnostic checks

→ **Next:** CIT takes over with evidence to author Stage 2 diagnosis

---

✅ **CIT** – Stage 2 Diagnosis Author

- Use Cursor's evidence to build Stage 2 document
- Include hypothesis list, falsifiers, and updated diagnosis
- Request Codex approval before any coding changes

→ **Next:** Codex reviews and decides next steps

---

✅ **Codex** – Oversight

- Review Stage 2 submission
- Decide next steps (hotfix, env correction, further analysis)
- Coordinate Stage 3 actions

→ **Next:** Approve diagnosis and assign Stage 3 work

---

## Important Notes

⚠️ **ChatGPT Hotfix Parked**

- ChatGPT's inline snippet (modal visibility + fetch wrapper) is **deferred** until Stage 2 confirms root cause
- Revisit after Codex oversight sign-off
- No code changes until Stage 2 diagnosis is approved

---

✅ **Status Update Format**

- All status updates follow revised troubleshooting framework format:
  - `✅` Completed actions
  - `⚠️` Warnings/issues
  - `→ Next` Upcoming actions
  - `🔴 BLOCKED` Blockers

---

## Context

- Production deploy `e3746a5` is live
- Initializer logs (`[INIT] …`) render correctly
- UI remains locked behind auth modal
- Chat submits trigger no network calls
- Automation rollout questions resolved per `.ai-agents/TEAM_RESPONSE_AUTOMATION_ROLLOUT_2025-11-05.md`
- Automation implementation should wait for Stage 2/3 outcome

---

## Deliverables

1. `.ai-agents/STAGE2_DIAGNOSIS_2025-11-05.md` (Cursor → CIT → Codex)
2. Oversight decision recorded once Stage 2 approved
3. Stage 3 action plan (Codex → team)

---

**Next Action:** Cursor begins DevTools capture per Stage 2 action plan
