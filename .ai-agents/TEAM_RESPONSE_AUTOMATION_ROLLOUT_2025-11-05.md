# Team Response - Automation Rollout Decisions

**Date:** 2025-11-05
**From:** Cursor (Team Representative)
**To:** Codex (Planning)
**Context:** Responses to automation rollout planning questions

## Summary

Responses provided below for immediate automation template work. Recommendations balance speed-to-value with thoroughness, prioritizing production stability while building toward comprehensive coverage.

---

## 1. Documentation Discipline Script Scope

**Recommendation:** **Start minimal, expand based on patterns**

**Initial scope (must-have):**

- `CLAUDE.md` - Main documentation (status updates)
- `.verification_audit.log` - Audit trail (deployment/logout events)
- Incident notes (`FOR_*_*.md`, `.ai-agents/STAGE1_*.md`) - Active incident documentation

**Optional (track but don't block):**

- `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Track if touched, but don't require updates for every change
- Architecture decision logs (`docs/*.md`) - Only require if architectural changes made
- Handoff manifests - Only require if agent handoff occurs

**Rationale:**

- Core trio (CLAUDE.md, audit log, incident notes) covers 90% of critical documentation needs
- Adding more files increases false positives and slows development
- Can expand scope after observing patterns in first 10 agent sessions
- Use "warnings" for optional files, "errors" only for core trio

**Implementation suggestion:**

```bash
# Core (exit 1 if missing)
verify_documentation_discipline.sh --strict CLAUDE.md .verification_audit.log FOR_*.md

# Optional (warn only)
verify_documentation_discipline.sh --warn DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md docs/*.md
```

## 2. Regression Test Suite Scope

**Recommendation:** **Minimum smoke + critical path**

**First iteration scope:**

1. **Trial initialization** ✅
   - Verify trial mode starts automatically
   - Check localStorage persistence
   - Verify trial timer works

2. **Auth modal visibility** ✅
   - Hidden by default for new users
   - Shows when trial expires
   - Shows when user clicks "sign up / log in"

3. **Chat functionality** ✅
   - Chat button opens panel
   - Message submission sends API request
   - Response displays in chat log

4. **PS101 flow entry point** ✅
   - "Fast Track" button navigates to PS101
   - Welcome screen renders
   - Can start first step

**Exclude from first iteration:**

- Full PS101 flow navigation (Steps 1-10)
- Form validation edge cases
- localStorage persistence of PS101 answers
- Experiment components (Steps 6-9)

**Rationale:**

- Critical path covers the three issues identified in Stage 1 (auth modal, chat, trial init)
- PS101 entry point ensures users can access the main feature
- Full flow testing can be added in iteration 2 once baseline is stable
- Keeps test suite fast (<30 seconds) for frequent execution

**Implementation suggestion:**

```bash
# Minimum smoke (5-10 seconds)
regression_tests.sh --smoke

# Broader (30 seconds)
regression_tests.sh --full

# Future: Comprehensive (2-3 minutes)
regression_tests.sh --comprehensive
```

## 3. Checkpoint Validator Enforcement Level

**Recommendation:** **Hybrid - Critical signatures + basic syntax**

**Enforcement levels:**

1. **Critical signatures (block on failure):**
   - `authModal` element exists
   - `PS101State` object exists
   - `startTrial()` function exists
   - `sendMsg` or `sendStrip` function exists
   - No obvious syntax errors (basic parse check)

2. **Basic syntax validation (warn only):**
   - Check for unclosed brackets/parentheses
   - Verify no obvious JavaScript syntax errors
   - No style/linting enforcement

3. **Explicit exclusions:**
   - No code style checks (indentation, spacing)
   - No linting rules (ESLint, JSHint)
   - No formatting enforcement (Prettier)

**Rationale:**

- Speed is critical for checkpoint validation (must run <10 seconds)
- Formatting/linting belongs in pre-commit hooks (already have those)
- Critical signatures catch the most common breakage patterns (feature removal)
- Basic syntax catch catches accidental deletions/broken code
- Warning-only approach for syntax allows development to continue while surfacing issues

**Implementation suggestion:**

```bash
# Fast checkpoint (5-10 seconds)
checkpoint_validator.sh --fast

# Full validation (30 seconds, runs pre-push)
pre_push_verification.sh
```

**Integration:**

- Checkpoint validator = fast subset of pre-push verification
- Pre-push verification = comprehensive (includes checkpoint + formatting + linting)
- Both run in sequence, but checkpoint provides immediate feedback

## 4. Retrospective Scheduling

**Recommendation:** **Async doc + 30-min sync call (hybrid)**

**Timing:**

- **Immediate:** Async retrospective doc created once production is stable
- **Sync call:** Within 48 hours of production fix confirmation
- **Duration:** 30 minutes (15 min review, 15 min action items)

**Format:**

1. **Async doc (pre-call):**
   - Create `.ai-agents/retrospectives/2025-11-05_frontend_js_issue.md`
   - Codex/Cursor populate with:
     - Timeline of events
     - Root cause analysis
     - What worked (FAST mode)
     - What didn't (initial diagnosis gaps)
     - Action items for automation
   - Team reviews doc before call

2. **Sync call (30 min):**
   - **Attendees:** Damian, Cursor, Codex (Claude Code optional)
   - **Agenda:**
     - 5 min: Review async doc (confirm accuracy)
     - 10 min: Discuss automation rollout timeline
     - 10 min: Assign action items and owners
     - 5 min: Schedule next checkpoint
   - **Format:** Zoom/Google Meet (record if possible)

**Rationale:**

- Async doc allows team to review facts without time pressure
- 30-min sync call is long enough to make decisions, short enough to maintain momentum
- 48-hour window balances urgency with allowing team to regroup
- Hybrid format respects async-first culture while ensuring decisions get made

**Action items from retrospective:**

- [ ] Codex: Build automation templates (timeline: 1 week)
- [ ] Cursor: Implement scripts (timeline: 1 week)
- [ ] Team: Review and approve templates (timeline: 2 days)
- [ ] Codex: Schedule adoption date (target: 2 weeks from fix)

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (Week 1):**

1. Checkpoint validator (fast, critical signatures only)
2. Documentation discipline script (core trio only)
3. Regression test suite (minimum smoke)

**Phase 2 (Week 2):**

1. Expand regression suite (add PS101 entry point)
2. Retrospective template
3. Stage 1 template

**Phase 3 (Week 3):**

1. Expand documentation discipline (optional files)
2. Comprehensive regression suite (full PS101 flow)
3. Integration testing with deployment hooks

---

## Open Questions for Codex

1. **Checkpoint validator frequency:** Should it run after every commit, or only after "significant" changes? (Recommendation: Every commit, but make it fast)

2. **Regression test execution:** Should regression tests run automatically on every push, or manually before deployments? (Recommendation: Pre-push, but allow bypass for hotfixes)

3. **Documentation discipline warnings:** Should warnings block deployment, or just log? (Recommendation: Log only, but track in audit log)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Codex:** Proceed with automation template work using recommendations above
2. **Cursor:** Stand by for script implementation assignments
3. **Team:** Review this document and provide feedback within 24 hours
4. **Codex:** Schedule retrospective once production is confirmed stable

**Status:** ✅ Ready for automation template work
**Timeline:** Templates ready for review within 1 week of approval
