# Team Note – Stage 2 Evidence Ready for CIT

**Date:** 2025-11-05
**From:** Cursor (Evidence Capture)
**To:** CIT, Codex
**Status:** ✅ Evidence captured, ready for diagnosis

---

## Summary

Stage 2 evidence capture complete. Critical findings documented in `.ai-agents/STAGE2_DIAGNOSIS_2025-11-05.md`. CIT diagnosis section filled; awaiting Codex review.

---

## Key Findings

**Critical Issues Identified:**

1. ❌ **`initApp` is undefined**
   - The consolidated initialization function from commits `3acab1d`/`e3746a5` is missing
   - This explains why auth modal logic and UI progression aren't working

2. ❌ **API base configuration missing**
   - `window.__API_BASE` is undefined
   - No meta tag fallback (`<meta name="api-base">`)
   - Chat cannot send requests (no API endpoint configured)

3. ❌ **Auth modal hard-coded visible**
   - `document.getElementById('authModal')?.style.display` returns `"block"`
   - Modal never hides, blocking entire UI
   - Chat UI inaccessible

4. ❌ **Chat UI inaccessible**
   - Cannot test chat submission
   - Modal covers entire viewport

---

## Root Cause Hypothesis

**Likely Cause:** Deployed files are from commit `ffbd9f8` (PS101 v2 + auth UI merged) which **predates the consolidated `initApp()` function**. The initialization code that should:

- Check authentication state on page load
- Hide/show auth modal appropriately
- Configure API base from environment/meta
- Start trial mode for unauthenticated users

...is **missing from the production build**.

## Next Steps

✅ **Cursor:** Evidence capture complete
✅ **CIT:** Stage 2 diagnosis documented (see Part 3)
→ **Codex:** Review diagnosis and decide on redeploy vs hotfix

**CIT Instructions:**

- Review evidence in `.ai-agents/STAGE2_DIAGNOSIS_2025-11-05.md` (Part 2: Evidence Captured)
- Build hypothesis list with falsifiers
- Reference deployment playbook options as remediation
- Request Codex approval before coding

## Files Updated

- `.ai-agents/STAGE2_DIAGNOSIS_2025-11-05.md` - Evidence captured in Part 2

**Status:** ✅ Ready for CIT diagnosis
