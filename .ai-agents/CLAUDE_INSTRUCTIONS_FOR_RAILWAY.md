My apologies for the continued interface issues. This file contains the explicit request for the manual action required to proceed.

**Objective:** Create the new canonical Render service.

**Please go to your Render dashboard and perform the following actions:**

1. Navigate to the **wimd-career-coaching** project.
2. Click to create a **new service**.
3. Select to connect a **GitHub repository**.
4. Choose the repository: **DAMIANSEGUIN/wimd-render-deploy**.
5. Set the service name to: **mosaic-backend**.
6. Ensure the deployment is from the **main** branch (or your default branch).
7. Set the **root directory** to **/** (the root of the repository).
8. **Do not** create any environment variables at this stage.

Once this is complete, please notify me so I can proceed to the next phase of the plan (Environment Rehydration).
