# MASTER INDEX - SESSION RECOVERY & QUICK START

**Created:** 2025-11-07 17:20 EST
**Purpose:** Single entry point for complete context restoration after crash/new session

---

## 🚀 QUICK START PROMPT (Copy/Paste This)

```
cd /Users/damianseguin/WIMD-Deploy-Project

Read this file first:
.ai-agents/MASTER_INDEX_SESSION_RECOVERY.md

This is the master index that will guide you through:
1. Session start protocol (MANDATORY checklist)
2. Current issue diagnosis and fix
3. All project documentation
4. Advanced techniques used in diagnostics

After reading the master index, confirm you understand the current status and what action is needed.
```

---

## 📋 SESSION START SEQUENCE (Follow This Order)

### Step 1: MANDATORY Session Start Protocol

**File:** `.ai-agents/SESSION_START_PROTOCOL.md`
**Action:** Run through entire checklist before doing ANYTHING else

**Quick commands to run:**

```bash
# Verify critical features
./scripts/verify_critical_features.sh

# Check recent commits
git log -5 --oneline

# Check for handoff
ls -1t .ai-agents/handoff_*.json | head -1

# Check for urgent files
ls -1 URGENT_* FOR_*_AGENT*.md 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 2: Read Current Issue Recovery Document

**File:** `.ai-agents/SESSION_RECOVERY_2025-11-07_1712.md`
**Contains:**

- Complete problem description
- Exact fix code to apply
- File and line number
- Deployment checklist
- Verification steps

### Step 3: Understand the Diagnostic Approach Used

**File:** `.ai-agents/DOM_TIMING_PLAYBOOK_PROTOCOL.md`
**Why read this:**

- Explains the DOM timing issue pattern
- Prevention checklist for future
- Reference implementation
- Common mistakes to avoid

**Advanced technique used:**

- Chain-of-Verification prompt (see Advanced Techniques section below)
- This helped identify the root cause vs symptoms

### Step 4: Review Recent Deployment Attempts

**Files (in chronological order):**

1. `.ai-agents/DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_2025-11-07.md` - First deployment result
2. `.ai-agents/DEPLOYMENT_ATTEMPT_2_2025-11-07.md` - Second deployment (config only)

**Key takeaway:** Fix was documented but never actually applied to code

---

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS SNAPSHOT

**Production:** 🔴 BROKEN - <https://whatismydelta.com>
**Error:** `initApp is not defined`
**Root Cause:** Missing `document.readyState` check in DOMContentLoaded listener
**Fix Status:** IDENTIFIED, DOCUMENTED, NOT YET APPLIED
**File to Fix:** `mosaic_ui/index.html` line 4018
**Time Estimate:** 12 minutes (apply + deploy + verify)

---

## 🧠 ADVANCED TECHNIQUES REFERENCE

### Chain-of-Verification Prompt (Used in This Session)

**Source:** `/Users/damianseguin/COMPANION GUIDE- PRODUCTION PROMPTS FOR ADVANCED TECHNIQUES.txt`

**Template:**

```
[YOUR ANALYSIS REQUEST]

After providing your initial analysis, complete these verification steps:

1. List three specific ways your analysis could be incomplete, misleading, or incorrect
2. For each potential issue, cite specific evidence from [DOCUMENT/DATA] that either
   confirms or refutes the concern
3. Provide a revised analysis that incorporates verified corrections

Do not skip the verification stage. I need to see your self-critique before the final answer.
```

**When this was used:**

- Diagnosing DOM timing issues (2025-11-07 ~16:12)
- Helped distinguish between deployment issues vs code errors
- Prevented false positive from "config fix" in Attempt #2

**Other techniques in companion guide:**

- Adversarial Stress-Test Template
- Strategic Edge Case Template
- Reverse Prompting Template
- Multi-Persona Debate Template
- Deliberate Over-Instruction Template

## 🔑 ESSENTIAL COMMANDS CHEAT SHEET

### Session Start

```bash
# Change to project directory
cd /Users/damianseguin/WIMD-Deploy-Project

# Verify critical features
./scripts/verify_critical_features.sh

# Check recent activity
git log -5 --oneline
git status

# Check for handoffs/urgent files
ls -1t .ai-agents/handoff_*.json | head -1
ls -1 URGENT_* FOR_*_AGENT*.md 2>/dev/null
```

### Health Checks

```bash
# Backend health
curl https://what-is-my-delta-site-production.up.render.app/health

# Production site status
curl -I https://whatismydelta.com

# Check deployed line count (should be ~4023)
curl -s https://whatismydelta.com | wc -l
```

### Deployment (Use Wrappers!)

```bash
# Deploy frontend (CORRECT)
./scripts/deploy.sh netlify

# Deploy backend (CORRECT)
./scripts/deploy.sh render

# Deploy both (CORRECT)
./scripts/deploy.sh all

# ❌ WRONG - Don't use raw commands
# netlify deploy --prod
# git push render-origin main
```

### Post-Deploy Verification

```bash
# Wait for CDN propagation
sleep 90

# Run verification script
./scripts/verify_live_deployment.sh

# Check specific feature
curl -s https://whatismydelta.com | grep "Phase 2.5"
```

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES (From Session Start Protocol)

### NEVER Do These Without Wrapper Scripts

- ❌ `git push render-origin main`
- ❌ `netlify deploy --prod`
- ❌ Any deployment command directly

### ALWAYS Use Wrapper Scripts

- ✅ `./scripts/push.sh render-origin main`
- ✅ `./scripts/deploy.sh netlify`
- ✅ `./scripts/deploy.sh render`

### Before ANY Code Changes

1. Run `./scripts/verify_critical_features.sh`
2. Check TROUBLESHOOTING_CHECKLIST.md
3. Never remove auth without approval
4. Never replace files without checking feature loss
5. Follow pre-commit hooks (no --no-verify)

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

**You have successfully restored context when you can answer:**

- [ ] What is the production URL? (<https://whatismydelta.com>)
- [ ] What is currently broken? (initApp not defined)
- [ ] Which file needs fixing? (mosaic_ui/index.html line 4018)
- [ ] What is the exact fix? (Add document.readyState check)
- [ ] Which deployment command to use? (./scripts/deploy.sh netlify)
- [ ] What verification is needed post-deploy? (Browser console check)
- [ ] Where are the session start rules? (SESSION_START_PROTOCOL.md)
- [ ] What technique was used in diagnosis? (Chain-of-Verification)

**If you can't answer all of these, re-read Tier 1 documents.**

---

## 📞 HANDOFF PROTOCOL

**When handing off to another agent:**

1. Update SESSION_RECOVERY document with current status
2. Create handoff manifest: `./scripts/create_handoff_manifest.sh`
3. Point incoming agent to this MASTER_INDEX
4. Specify which Tier 2 docs are relevant to their task

**When receiving handoff:**

1. Read latest handoff_*.json
2. Read this MASTER_INDEX
3. Follow SESSION_START_PROTOCOL.md
4. Read relevant Tier 2 docs for current task

---

## 🔐 SECURITY & SAFETY NOTES

**Files that should NEVER be committed:**

- `.env` files with secrets
- Any file containing API keys
- Database credentials
- Authentication tokens

**Pre-commit hooks will block:**

- Context manager violations
- SQLite syntax in PostgreSQL code
- Silent exception swallowing
- Removing authentication without approval

**If blocked by hook:**

- Review the specific violation
- Fix the code issue
- Do NOT use `--no-verify` without explicit approval
