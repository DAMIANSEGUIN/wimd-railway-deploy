# GeminiStart Note
Project: Mosaic (Next.js/React frontend deployed via Netlify & Railway, built from `/Users/damianseguin/AI_Workspace/WIMD-Railway-Deploy-Project`, includes `frontend` and `mosaic_ui`). Current blocker: `verify_critical_features.sh` warns about `API_BASE` (should be relative `/wimd`) and missing prod authentication UI. Please read `/Users/damianseguin/AI_Workspace/WIMD-Railway-Deploy-Project/.ai-agents/GEMINI_CLI_WORKFLOW.md`, `.ai-agents/GEMINI_CONTEXT_BRIEF.md`, and the latest session document (e.g., `.ai-agents/GEMINI_SESSION_20251118_110500.md`) before doing anything. Use those docs as your entry point for every Gemini session.
