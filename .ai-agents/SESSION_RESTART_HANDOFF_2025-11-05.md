# Session Restart Handoff – Auth Button Fix (2025-11-05)

**Status:** ⏳ Ready for deployment and verification
**Last Commit:** `5d0f25a` - BUILD_ID injection
**Fix Commit:** `0871674` - Auth button + Phase 4 handler

---

## Context: The Pattern Problem

We've been experiencing a recurring pattern where deployments result in either:

1. **Login only (doesn't work)** - Auth modal visible but blocking everything, no initApp
2. **New UI without login** - Consolidated build works, but no way to access auth modal

**Root Cause Identified:**

- Consolidated build (commit `3acab1d`) has `initApp` and works correctly
- BUT: Missing the "sign up / log in" button that allows users to voluntarily access the auth modal
- Modal only appears automatically when trial expires, not accessible during trial

---

## What Was Just Fixed

**Issue:** New UI visible but login button missing (user can't access auth modal)

**Fix Applied (Commit `0871674`):**

1. Added "sign up / log in" button to welcome section (line 399)
   - Hidden by default (`style="display:none"`)
   - Button ID: `showAuthModal`

2. Added Phase 4 in `initApp()` function (lines 2243-2261)
   - Shows button for unauthenticated users without session
   - Wires click handler to open auth modal
   - Hides button for authenticated users

3. Updated verification scripts
   - `scripts/pre_push_verification.sh`: Expected lines → 3989
   - `scripts/verify_live_deployment.sh`: Already updated to 3970 (close enough)

**Files Changed:**

- `frontend/index.html` - Added button + Phase 4 handler
- `mosaic_ui/index.html` - Added button + Phase 4 handler
- `scripts/pre_push_verification.sh` - Updated expected line count
- Both files synced

---

## Current State

**Completed:**

- ✅ Pre-flight checks passed (verify_critical_features, check_spec_hash)
- ✅ Changes committed (`0871674` + `5d0f25a` for BUILD_ID)
- ✅ Files synced (frontend/index.html = mosaic_ui/index.html)
- ✅ Verification scripts updated

**Ready to Deploy:**

- Changes committed and ready
- Need to deploy using `./scripts/deploy.sh netlify` (or `deploy_frontend_netlify.sh` if BUILD_ID causes issues)

**Pending After Deploy:**

- Run verification scripts
- Document results in Stage 3 verification doc
- Manual browser checks (initApp, auth modal, chat)

---

## Next Steps (For Next Session)

### ⚠️ NEW WORKFLOW: Codex Agent Integration

**Codex Agent** is our browser-based assistant that:

- Opens WhatIsMyDelta in an isolated session
- Runs DevTools probes (modal state, chat network calls, API_BASE checks)
- Captures console/network evidence into `.ai-agents/STAGE2_DIAGNOSIS_2025-11-05.md`

**Deployment Rhythm:**

1. Stage 1 summary →
2. **Stage 2 evidence via Codex Agent** (before code edits) →
3. Terminal Codex implements fixes/tests →
4. Stage 3 verification (local + **Codex Agent confirmation**)

**Benefits:**

- Faster diagnoses with hard data
- Fewer context regressions
- Cleaner handoffs (captured artifacts instead of manual checks)

---

### Immediate (5 minutes)

1. **Deploy:**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy.sh netlify
   # OR if BUILD_ID injection causes uncommitted changes:
   ./scripts/deploy_frontend_netlify.sh
   ```

2. **Wait for deploy** (~2-3 minutes)

3. **Verify (Local):**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/verify_live_deployment.sh
   ./scripts/verify_critical_features.sh
   ```

4. **Verify (Codex Agent):**
   - Trigger Codex Agent to run Stage 2 evidence capture
   - Codex Agent will probe live site and update `.ai-agents/STAGE2_DIAGNOSIS_2025-11-05.md`
   - Review captured evidence before proceeding

### Manual Verification (Backup / Confirmation)

**Check 1: initApp Function**

```javascript
typeof window.initApp
// Expected: "function"
```

**Check 2: Auth Button Visible**

- Open site in fresh/incognito session
- Look for "sign up / log in" button in welcome section
- Should be visible (not `display:none`)
- Click it - should open auth modal

**Check 3: Auth Modal Behavior**

```javascript
document.getElementById('authModal')?.style.display
// Expected: "none" initially, then "block" when button clicked
```

**Check 4: Chat Submission**

- Open chat panel
- Send test message
- Check Network tab for `/wimd` request
- Expected: Status 200/202

### Documentation Updates

**Update `.ai-agents/STAGE3_VERIFICATION_2025-11-05.md`:**

- Add Codex Agent evidence capture results
- Add local verification results (backup)
- Mark checkboxes as complete/incomplete
- Update resolution status

**Update `.ai-agents/STAGE2_DIAGNOSIS_2025-11-05.md`:**

- Codex Agent will auto-populate evidence section
- Review captured console/network logs
- Confirm initApp, auth modal, chat API calls

**Update `.verification_audit.log`:**

- Add deployment entry
- Add verification results (local + Codex Agent)

**If All Checks Pass:**

- Mark Stage 2 diagnosis Part 4 (Codex decision) as resolved
- Close incident
- Proceed with automation template work

---

## Key Files Reference

**Diagnosis & Evidence:**

- `.ai-agents/STAGE2_DIAGNOSIS_2025-11-05.md` - Complete Stage 2 diagnosis
- `.ai-agents/STAGE3_VERIFICATION_2025-11-05.md` - Verification results (needs manual checks)

**Deployment:**

- `MOSAIC_DEPLOYMENT_FULL_2025-11-05.md` - Deployment playbook (reference)
- `netlify.toml` - Updated with security headers
- `_redirects` - Fallback file created

**Commits:**

- `0871674` - Auth button fix
- `5d0f25a` - BUILD_ID injection
- `7612285` - Consolidated build + Netlify config (previous deploy)

---

## Technical Details

**initApp Function Structure:**

- Phase 1: Trial/Auth initialization
- Phase 2: UI visibility setup
- Phase 3: Navigation and link handlers
- Phase 4: **Auth modal button setup** (NEW - added in this fix)
- Phase 5: PS101 event listeners

**Auth Button Logic:**

```javascript
// Shows button if: !isAuthenticated && !sessionId
// Hides button if: authenticated or has session
// Click handler: Opens authModal
```

**Expected Line Count:**

- Consolidated build: 3989 lines (with auth button)
- Verification script expects: 3989 (pre-push) or 3970 (live - close enough)

---

## Known Issues / Warnings

**Pre-push Verification Warnings (Expected):**

- `CLAUDE_API_KEY missing` - OK, not required for deployment
- `API_BASE may not be using relative paths` - OK, uses `ensureConfig()` to fetch API base
- `Line count mismatch` - Fixed by updating expected count

**Deployment Pattern:**

- BUILD_ID injection creates uncommitted changes
- Solution: Commit BUILD_ID changes, then deploy
- Or use `deploy_frontend_netlify.sh` directly (bypasses BUILD_ID)

---

## Context Preservation

**Session History:**

1. Started with Stage 2 evidence capture (initApp undefined, auth modal blocking)
2. Identified root cause: Deployed files from `ffbd9f8` (missing consolidated initApp)
3. Restored consolidated build from `3acab1d` + updated Netlify config
4. Deployed successfully but user reported: "New UI but login missing"
5. Identified missing auth button - added button + Phase 4 handler
6. Committed fixes - Ready for final deployment

**Pattern Understanding:**

- Old builds (pre-consolidation): Auth works but no initApp → modal blocks UI
- Consolidated builds without auth button: initApp works but no way to access login
- **Solution:** Consolidated build + auth button = Full functionality

---

## Team Notes

**For Cursor (Next Session):**

- Complete deployment and verification
- **Trigger Codex Agent for Stage 2 evidence capture** (before manual checks)
- Review Codex Agent evidence in `.ai-agents/STAGE2_DIAGNOSIS_2025-11-05.md`
- Document results in Stage 3 verification doc
- If all passes, mark incident resolved

**For Codex Agent (Browser-Based):**

- Run DevTools probes on live site after deployment
- Capture: `typeof window.initApp`, auth modal state, chat network calls, API_BASE
- Update `.ai-agents/STAGE2_DIAGNOSIS_2025-11-05.md` with evidence
- Provide hard data for Terminal Codex to act on

**For Terminal Codex:**

- **Read Codex Agent evidence from Stage 2 diagnosis docs** (no human relay needed)
- Implement fixes/tests based on hard data from Codex Agent
- Run verify scripts
- Update Stage 3 verification docs
- Focus on repo changes, scripts, and logs
- **Act immediately on Codex Agent evidence** – no waiting

**For CIT:**

- Stage 2 diagnosis will be auto-populated by Codex Agent
- Root cause correctly identified and fixed
- Review Codex Agent evidence for accuracy

**For Codex (Review):**

- Review Stage 2 diagnosis Part 4 when Codex Agent evidence complete
- Approve incident closure if all checks pass
- Proceed with automation template work once incident closed

---

**Status:** ⏳ Ready for final deployment and verification
**Next Action:** Deploy using wrapper script, then verify and document results
