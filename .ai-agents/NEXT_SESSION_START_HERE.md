## Quick Summary

**What happened:** Fixed missing "sign up / log in" button in consolidated build. Auth modal exists but wasn't accessible to users.

**What's done:**

- ✅ Auth button added to welcome section
- ✅ Phase 4 handler in initApp wired up
- ✅ Changes committed (`0871674`, `5d0f25a`)
- ✅ Verification scripts updated

**What's next:**

1. Deploy using `./scripts/deploy.sh netlify`
2. Verify with automated scripts (local)
3. **Trigger Codex Agent for Stage 2 evidence capture** (browser-based probes)
4. Review Codex Agent evidence in `.ai-agents/STAGE2_DIAGNOSIS_2025-11-05.md`
5. Document results and close incident

## Full Details

**See:** `.ai-agents/SESSION_RESTART_HANDOFF_2025-11-05.md` for complete context

**Quick commands:**

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh netlify
# Wait 3 min
./scripts/verify_live_deployment.sh
# Then trigger Codex Agent for Stage 2 evidence capture
# Codex Agent will probe live site and update diagnosis doc
```

**⚠️ NEW: Two-Agent Tandem Model**

- **Terminal Codex** – Repo work (coding, scripts, docs)
- **Codex Agent** – Browser-based, traces real user flows
- Codex Agent captures evidence BEFORE code edits
- Terminal Codex reads evidence and implements fixes immediately (no human relay)
- Staging notes (Stage 1/2/3 files) are the shared source of truth

**Codex Reset Protocol:**

- Invoke "Codex Reset Protocol" when agent drifts
- Both agents re-run session start protocol, restate Present State → Desired Outcome, re-log session
- See `.ai-agents/CODEX_RESET_PROTOCOL.md` for details

**All changes committed. Ready to deploy.**
