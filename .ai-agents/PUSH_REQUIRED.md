# Manual Push Required

**Date:** 2025-11-03 10:15 EST
**Status:** 🟡 Commit ready but not pushed to GitHub

## What Was Done

1. ✅ Diagnosed Netlify deployment mismatch
2. ✅ Synchronized `mosaic_ui/` with `frontend/`
3. ✅ Created commit `5b661b4`
4. ❌ Push blocked - SSH authentication required

## Current State

**Local:**

- Commit `5b661b4` includes mosaic_ui sync
- 3 commits ahead of origin/main: 5b661b4, cf26aa0, 9409b2b

**GitHub origin/main:**

- At commit `f709d52`
- Missing 3 local commits

**Netlify:**

- Currently serving content from local manual deployment
- Auto-deploy will trigger once commits pushed to GitHub

## Manual Action Required

```bash
cd /Users/damianseguin/WIMD-Deploy-Project
git push origin main
```

This will:

1. Push 3 commits to GitHub
2. Trigger Netlify auto-deployment
3. Deploy PS101 v2 to production

## Verification After Push

```bash
# Wait 2 minutes for Netlify deployment
sleep 120

# Verify deployment
curl -s https://whatismydelta.com/ | head -5
curl -s https://whatismydelta.com/ | wc -l  # Should be 3427 lines

# Verify critical features
./scripts/verify_critical_features.sh
```
