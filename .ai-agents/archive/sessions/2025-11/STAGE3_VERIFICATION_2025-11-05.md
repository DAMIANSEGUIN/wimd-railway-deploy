- [ ] Modal can be closed
- [ ] UI content is visible behind modal (not blocked)

**Evidence:**

```
[To be captured from browser DevTools]
```

- [ ] Chat panel opens when clicked
- [ ] Message submission sends network request to `/wimd`
- [ ] Network request appears in Network tab
- [ ] Response received (or error documented)

**Evidence:**

```

- [ ] `/config` endpoint accessible
- [ ] API calls succeed

**Evidence:**

```
[To be captured from browser console]
```

```

---

## Verification Results

### Automated Verification ✅

**Status:** All automated checks pass

**Command:** `./scripts/verify_live_deployment.sh`

```
✅ Site reachable
✅ Line count matches (3970 lines)
✅ Title correct: What Is My Delta — Find Your Next Career Move
✅ Authentication UI present (8 references)
✅ PS101 flow present (43 references)
✅ Experiment components present (4 references)

✅ LIVE DEPLOYMENT VERIFIED
```

**Note:** Updated verification script expected line count from 3873 (old build) to 3970 (consolidated build).

**Command:** `./scripts/verify_critical_features.sh`

```
✅ Authentication UI present (34 occurrences)
✅ PS101 flow present (174 references)
⚠️  WARNING: API_BASE may not be using relative paths
✅ Production authentication detected

✅ All critical features verified
```

### Manual Browser Verification

**Status:** ⚠️ Incomplete – Login CTA hidden when stale sessionId detected
**Browser:** _[To be filled]_
**URL:** <https://whatismydelta.com>
**Date/Time:** _[To be filled]_

**Required Manual Checks:**

#### 1. initApp Function Verification

**Check:** `typeof window.initApp` in console

**Expected:** `"function"`
**Actual:** _[To be logged below]_

**Steps:**

1. Open <https://whatismydelta.com> in browser
2. Open DevTools Console (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
3. Run: `typeof window.initApp`
4. Log result below

**Result:**

```
[To be logged here]
```

---

#### 2. Auth Modal Visibility (Fresh Session)

**Check:** Auth modal hides after initialization (no forced `display:block`)

**Expected:** Modal is hidden (`display: none` or not visible) for first-time visitors after `initApp` runs
**Actual:** _[To be logged below]_

**Steps:**

1. Open site in **fresh/incognito session** (or clear localStorage/cookies)
2. Open DevTools Console
3. Wait for `[INIT]` logs to complete (check console for initialization messages)
4. Inspect `#authModal` element:
   - Check computed style: `getComputedStyle(document.getElementById('authModal')).display`
   - Or check inline style: `document.getElementById('authModal')?.style.display`
5. Verify main UI content is visible (not blocked by modal)
6. Log results below

**Result:**

```
[INIT] logs present: [Yes/No]
Modal display value: "block" – remains forced because stale `delta_session_id` exists
Main UI visible: No (CTA hidden; modal covers viewport)
Observation: initializer hides CTA when `sessionId` is truthy. Stale localStorage prevents login access.
Resolution update: guard switched locally to `if (!isAuthenticated)` in both `mosaic_ui/index.html` and `frontend/index.html`; redeploy + production retest pending.
```

#### 3. Chat Submission Network Request

**Check:** Chat message sends network request to `/wimd`

**Expected:** Network request appears in Network tab with status 200/202
**Actual:** _[To be logged below]_

**Steps:**

1. Ensure auth modal is hidden (see check #2)
2. Locate chat button/interface (should be accessible)
3. Open DevTools Network tab
4. Click to open chat panel
5. Type a test message (e.g., "test")
6. Submit message
7. Check Network tab for request to `/wimd` or similar endpoint
8. Log request details below

**Result:**

```
Chat button accessible: [Yes/No]
Chat panel opens: [Yes/No]
Network request URL: [to be logged]
Request method: [GET/POST/etc]
Response status: [200/202/etc]
Response body (if applicable): [to be logged]
```

### Manual Verification Summary

**All Checks Pass:**

- [ ] Check 1: `initApp` is a function
- [ ] Check 2: Auth modal hides in fresh session
- [ ] Check 3: Chat submission sends network request

**Status:** _[To be updated after manual verification]_

---

## Issues Found

**Automated Verification:** Content checks passed (line count, title, UI presence) - **Does not verify functionality**

**Manual Verification:** _[To be documented after manual checks]_

_[Document any issues discovered during manual verification]_

---

## Resolution Status

- [x] Code changes committed (commit `0c44e11`)
- [x] Local verification passes (`pre_push_verification.sh`)
- [ ] **Deployment pending** - Netlify Runner Agent required (EPERM blocked Terminal Codex)
- [ ] Manual browser verification pending (initApp, auth modal, chat) - **Cannot verify until deployment succeeds**
- [ ] Issues found - Document in Stage 2 diagnosis for follow-up
- [x] Blockers identified - Escalated to Netlify Runner Agent

**Current Status:**

- ✅ Code changes committed (commit `0c44e11`)
- ✅ Local verification passes (`pre_push_verification.sh`)
- 🔄 **Deployment IN PROGRESS** - Netlify Runner Agent triggered deployment (2025-11-06T22:35:14Z)
- ⏳ **Awaiting deployment completion** - Then verification required
- ⏳ **Manual browser verification REQUIRED** - Fix not proven until verified:
  1. `typeof window.initApp` → expect `"function"` (NOT verified yet - deployment in progress)
  2. Auth modal hides after init in fresh session → expect hidden, UI visible (NOT verified yet - deployment in progress)
  3. Chat submission sends `/wimd` request → expect status 200/202 (NOT verified yet - deployment in progress)

**⚠️ DO NOT mark as fixed/resolved until:**

1. Deployment completes successfully
2. Wait 60-90 seconds for CDN propagation
3. Run automated verification: `./scripts/verify_live_deployment.sh`
4. Manual browser verification confirms all three checks pass in production

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate:**

1. Perform manual browser verification (3 checks listed above)
2. Log results in "Manual Browser Verification" section
3. Update "Manual Verification Summary" checkboxes

**If all manual checks pass (ONLY after deployment succeeds and verification confirms):**

- Mark incident resolved in Stage 2 diagnosis (with evidence)
- Update Stage 2 diagnosis Part 4 (Codex decision) with resolution (with proof)
- Close incident (only after all checks verified)
- Proceed with automation template work per revised framework

**If manual checks fail:**

- Document issues in "Issues Found" section
- Determine if additional fixes needed or further investigation required
- Update Codex with findings
- Consider hotfix if critical
