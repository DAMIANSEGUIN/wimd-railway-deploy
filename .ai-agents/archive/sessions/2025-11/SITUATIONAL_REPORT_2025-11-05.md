# SITUATIONAL REPORT – FRONTEND JS TRIAL INITIALIZER

**Timestamp (UTC):** 2025-11-05T18:42:54Z
**Prepared by:** Codex (Planning)
**Incident ID:** FOR_NARS_FRONTEND_JAVASCRIPT_ISSUE_2025-11-04

---

## Current Production State

- Production site `https://whatismydelta.com/` still exhibits the DOMContentLoaded trial initializer halt. Console output stops after `[TRIAL] Initializing auth/trial mode...`.
- Chat CTA and trial mode remain non-functional; auth modal stays hidden.
- No mitigations deployed since commit `180bbfd`; user experience degraded.

## Active Response Mode

- Team operating in **FAST mode** under `TROUBLESHOOTING_CHECKLIST.md` to restore production functionality before adopting the revised framework.
- Revised framework (`REVISED_TROUBLESHOOTING_FRAMEWORK_2025-11-05.md`) documented and ready for post-incident adoption.

## Immediate Tasks (FAST Mode)

1. **Instrument Trial Initializer** – Add defensive logging/try-catch helpers around `localStorage` access and downstream branches (`mosaic_ui/index.html:2021`).
2. **Consolidate DOMContentLoaded Handlers** – Merge the four listeners (`mosaic_ui/index.html:2021`, `2275`, `2300`, `3526`) into a single orchestrated initializer to remove race conditions.
3. **Re-run Verification Scripts** – Execute `./scripts/verify_critical_features.sh`, DevTools breakpoint validation, and `./scripts/verify_live_deployment.sh` once fix is applied.
4. **Document Evidence** – Update `CLAUDE.md`, `.verification_audit.log`, and the incident report with outcomes and console traces.

**Owner:** Cursor (implementation) with Codex oversight; handoff summary required after execution.

## Framework Track Tasks

1. Review and approve `REVISED_TROUBLESHOOTING_FRAMEWORK_2025-11-05.md`.
2. Schedule build-out of automation artifacts:
   - `.ai-agents/checkpoint_validator.sh`
   - `scripts/verify_documentation_discipline.sh`
   - `scripts/regression_tests.sh`
   - `.ai-agents/templates/STAGE_1_TEMPLATE.md`
   - `.ai-agents/templates/RETROSPECTIVE_TEMPLATE.md`

**Owner:** Codex to coordinate; implementation delegated to Cursor post-incident.

## Coordination & Handoffs

- **Cursor:** Execute FAST-mode fixes, capture verification artifacts, update docs, and inform Codex.
- **Terminal Codex (CLI):** Available for deeper file checks or large-scale searches on demand; reference revised framework file.
- **Claude Code:** Stand by to validate deployment/logs once fixes ready; not currently engaged.
- **Human:** Provide approvals for any destructive rollback or deployment trigger; no pending approvals as of this report.

## Next Checkpoint

- Confirm FAST-mode remediation completed and documented.
- Hold quick review to ratify framework adoption timing and assign automation deliverables.
