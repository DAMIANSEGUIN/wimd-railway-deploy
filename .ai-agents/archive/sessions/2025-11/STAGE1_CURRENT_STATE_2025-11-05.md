# STAGE 1 – CURRENT STATE → DESIRED OUTCOME

## Summary

- Live Netlify deploy (commit `e3746a5`) presents the refreshed UI, but critical interactions remain broken.
- Login/register modal now renders immediately and blocks the rest of the UI even for first-time visitors.
- Chat CTA opens the panel but sends no messages; console shows no network activity on submit.
- Issue persists after DOMContentLoaded consolidation on both `mosaic_ui/index.html` and `frontend/index.html`.

## Current State (Observed)

| Item | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trial initializer console sequence | ✅ `[INIT] Application initialization complete` renders | Chrome DevTools (WhatIsMyDelta.com) |
| Login/Register controls | ❌ Modal renders immediately and stays open, hiding PS101 | DOM inspection: `#authModal` inline style `display:block`; JS never hides on load |
| Chat CTA | ❌ Button visible; click opens panel but `sendMsg` does nothing | Network tab shows no POST to `/wimd`; no console error |
| BUILD_ID / Spec hash | ✅ Verified pre-deploy | `.verification_audit.log` |
| Local storage helpers | ✅ `safeLocalStorageGet/Set` active | `mosaic_ui/index.html:1994` |

---

## Desired Outcome

1. Visitors see the login/register modal or equivalent CTA when not authenticated.
2. Chat helper opens, sends prompts to `https://mosaic-platform.vercel.app/wimd`, and displays responses.
3. All initialization logs remain green (`[INIT] Application initialization complete`).

---

## Reproduction Steps

1. Open Chrome → <https://whatismydelta.com/> (deploy timestamp 2025-11-05 ~18:10 UTC).
2. Observe page loads with updated layout; no login surface visible.
3. Open DevTools → Console logs show `[INIT] Phase 1 complete` through `[INIT] Application initialization complete`.
4. Click “help” → Chat panel displays; type message → Submit → No network request, UI unchanged.
5. Inspect Elements → `#authModal` is present but inline `style="display:none"` persists; no script toggles triggered.
6. Inspect Sources → `initApp()` defined; verify DOMContentLoaded handler attaches once.

---

## Diagnostics Collected

- `mosaic_ui/index.html` and `frontend/index.html` both include consolidated `initApp()` logic and `initPS101EventListeners()` (commit `3acab1d`).
- `safeLocalStorageGet` returns defaults; `sessionId` remains empty.
- `showSignUpPrompt()` sets modal display block only if `checkTrialExpired()` triggers (trial expiry).
- No explicit “Show login” CTA on initial render.
- Chat logic (`askCoach`) uses `API_BASE = 'https://mosaic-platform.vercel.app'`; lack of network request suggests handler not invoked (likely `sendMsg` not bound post-refactor).
- Both HTML entry points hardcode `<div id="authModal" ... style="display:block">`, so unauthenticated users see an immediate full-page auth overlay.

---

## Blockers / Open Questions

1. **Auth surface**: Should unauthenticated visitors immediately see the modal, or is an explicit CTA missing?
2. **Chat submission**: Did event binding change during consolidation (e.g., `sendMsg` button not wired)? Was there a race with `loadPrompts()` or other init functions?
3. **Fallback trial flow**: With modal hidden, trial logic may bypass prompting; confirm intended UX.

---

## Next Actions (Pending Approval)

1. Stage 2 verification checks: confirm event handlers attached post-initialization (auth toggle, chat send).
2. Compare live deployed JS bundle with repo copy to rule out build differences.
3. Implement fix plan (likely reintroduce explicit auth CTA and ensure chat `submit` handler binds before `initApp()` completes).
4. Re-run verification suite and redeploy once fixes validated.
