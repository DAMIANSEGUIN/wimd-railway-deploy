# SESSION RECOVERY DOCUMENT - 2025-11-07 17:12 EST

**CRITICAL: Use this to restore full context after session crash**

---

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE STATUS

**Production Site:** <https://whatismydelta.com>
**Status:** 🔴 **BROKEN** - JavaScript errors preventing site function
**Issue:** `Uncaught ReferenceError: initApp is not defined`
**Root Cause:** Missing `document.readyState` check in DOMContentLoaded listener
**Fix Status:** IDENTIFIED BUT NOT YET APPLIED

---

## 📋 QUICK START PROMPT FOR NEXT SESSION

**Copy/paste this to restore context:**

```
I need you to restore context from a session crash. Please read these files in order:

1. Session recovery: .ai-agents/SESSION_RECOVERY_2025-11-07_1712.md
2. Session start protocol: .ai-agents/SESSION_START_PROTOCOL.md
3. DOM timing issue: .ai-agents/DOM_TIMING_PLAYBOOK_PROTOCOL.md
4. Latest deployment: .ai-agents/DEPLOYMENT_ATTEMPT_2_2025-11-07.md
5. Deployment status: .ai-agents/DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_2025-11-07.md

Current issue: Production site has JavaScript error "initApp is not defined".
The fix is documented in DOM_TIMING_PLAYBOOK_PROTOCOL.md but not yet applied.
Need to add document.readyState check to mosaic_ui/index.html line 4018.

After reading these files, confirm you understand the issue and are ready to apply the fix.
```

## 🎯 CURRENT PROBLEM

### What's Broken

- **Production URL:** <https://whatismydelta.com>
- **Console Errors:**
  1. `Uncaught ReferenceError: initApp is not defined` at (index):4018:49
  2. `Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'appendChild')` at (index):1325:13
- **User Impact:** Chat doesn't work, login doesn't work, site appears broken

### Root Cause

**File:** `mosaic_ui/index.html` (line 4018)

**Current code (WRONG):**

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initApp, { once: true });
```

**Why it fails:**

- Script tag is at END of HTML (line 1103)
- By the time browser parses the script, DOM is already loaded
- DOMContentLoaded event has already fired
- Listener never executes
- `initApp()` never runs
- Everything breaks

**Required fix:**

```javascript
if (document.readyState === 'loading') {
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initApp, { once: true });
} else {
  initApp();
}
```

### Evidence

- **Screenshots:** User provided 2 screenshots showing console errors before/after typing in chat
- **Deployment:** Deploy ID `690e65bbdcfd486ed75af217` completed successfully
- **CDN:** Files deployed correctly to Netlify
- **Issue:** Code logic error, not deployment/caching problem

## ✅ WHAT'S WORKING

- ✅ Backend API: Railway deployment healthy
- ✅ Health checks: All passing
- ✅ Database: PostgreSQL connected
- ✅ Authentication system: Code present
- ✅ PS101 flow: Code present
- ✅ Netlify deployments: Successfully deploying files
- ✅ CDN: Serving correct files
- ✅ Phase 2.5 fix: DOM access moved inside `initApp()`

---

## ❌ WHAT'S BROKEN

- ❌ DOMContentLoaded listener: Missing `readyState` check
- ❌ Chat functionality: Cannot initialize
- ❌ Login/Auth: Cannot initialize
- ❌ All interactive elements: Cannot initialize
- ❌ Production site: Completely non-functional

---

## 🔧 THE FIX (Ready to Apply)

### File to Edit

`mosaic_ui/index.html`

### Line Number

4018

### Current Code

```javascript
  // Single consolidated DOMContentLoaded handler
  // DEPLOY_MARKER: DOMContentLoaded listener | Line ~4016 | Should be INSIDE IIFE
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initApp, { once: true });
})();
```

### Replacement Code

```javascript
  // Single consolidated DOMContentLoaded handler
  // DEPLOY_MARKER: DOMContentLoaded listener | Line ~4016 | Should be INSIDE IIFE
  // Fix: Check readyState since script is at end of HTML
  if (document.readyState === 'loading') {
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initApp, { once: true });
  } else {
    initApp();
  }
})();
```

### After Fixing mosaic_ui/index.html

**MUST ALSO UPDATE:** `frontend/index.html` (same fix, keep in sync)

---

## 📋 DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST (After Fix Applied)

### Pre-Deploy

```bash
# 1. Verify critical features
./scripts/verify_critical_features.sh

# 2. Test locally (if possible)
open mosaic_ui/index.html

# 3. Check browser console
# Should see: typeof initApp === "function"
```

### Deploy

```bash
# Use wrapper script (MANDATORY per SESSION_START_PROTOCOL)
./scripts/deploy.sh netlify

# OR manual (if wrapper unavailable)
cd mosaic_ui
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Post-Deploy Verification

```bash
# 1. Wait 60-90 seconds for CDN propagation

# 2. Hard refresh browser
# Chrome: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

# 3. Open DevTools Console

# 4. Check: typeof window.initApp
# Expected: "function"

# 5. Look for logs
# [INIT] Starting application initialization...
# [INIT] Phase 1: ...
# [INIT] Phase 2: ...
# [INIT] Phase 2.5: Initializing API check and chat...
# [INIT] Phase 2.5 complete
# [INIT] Phase 3: ...
# [INIT] Phase 4: ...

# 6. Test chat
# Click chat button → should open
# Type message → should send to /wimd

# 7. Test auth
# Click login button → modal should appear
```

---

## 🚦 OPERATING RULES (from SESSION_START_PROTOCOL)

### MANDATORY Before ANY Action

1. ✅ Run `./scripts/verify_critical_features.sh` BEFORE deployment
2. ✅ Never remove authentication without explicit approval
3. ✅ Never replace files without checking for feature loss
4. ✅ Follow pre-commit hooks (never --no-verify without approval)
5. ✅ Run DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md after deploys
6. ✅ **NEVER use raw `git push` or `netlify deploy`** - use wrapper scripts:
   - `./scripts/push.sh railway-origin main`
   - `./scripts/deploy.sh netlify`
   - `./scripts/deploy.sh railway`
   - `./scripts/deploy.sh all`

### If Wrapper Scripts Don't Exist

Ask user for permission before using raw commands.

## 🎓 LEARNING FROM THIS INCIDENT

### What Went Wrong

1. Fix was documented in DOM_TIMING_PLAYBOOK_PROTOCOL.md
2. But fix was never actually applied to code
3. Deployment #2 only changed netlify.toml config
4. User tested and found errors still present
5. Session crashed before fix could be applied
6. Had to restore context from scratch

### Prevention for Next Time

- ✅ Created this recovery document
- ✅ Includes quick-start prompt
- ✅ Includes exact file/line to fix
- ✅ Includes exact replacement code
- ✅ No ambiguity about what needs to be done

### Knowledge Captured

- DOM timing issues with end-of-body scripts
- Need for `document.readyState` check
- Distinction between "fix documented" vs "fix applied"
- Importance of post-deploy browser testing

## ✅ RESOLUTION (2025-11-09)

**Status:** DEPLOYED - Awaiting user browser testing

**What was deployed:**

- Commit 5cf9088: Added `document.readyState` check to prevent initApp race condition
- Commit 21144cd: Updated BUILD_ID footer
- Deploy ID: 6910f394e882c4ad31fac09b
- Production URL: <https://whatismydelta.com>

**Deployment method:**

- Used Solution C (Codex recommendation)
- Injected BUILD_ID just before deploy
- Reverted BUILD_ID after deploy to keep repo clean
- Avoided infinite loop bug in wrapper script

**Code verification (automated):**

- ✅ HTTP 200 response from production
- ✅ `document.readyState` check present in deployed HTML
- ✅ BUILD_ID matches commit hash (21144cd9)
- ✅ No uncommitted changes in local repo

**User testing required:**
User must test in browser to confirm:

1. No JavaScript errors in console
2. initApp function defined and executing
3. Chat functionality working
4. Login modal appearing
5. All interactive elements functional
