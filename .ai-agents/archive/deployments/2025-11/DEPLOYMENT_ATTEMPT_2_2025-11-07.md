# Deployment Attempt #2 - 2025-11-07 16:28

## What Was Changed

**File:** `netlify.toml`
**Change:** Added `[context.production]` section to explicitly enforce `publish = "mosaic_ui"`

```toml
[build]
  base = "mosaic_ui"
  publish = "mosaic_ui"

[context.production]
  publish = "mosaic_ui"
```

**Rationale:** ChatGPT suggested this to ensure Netlify definitely publishes from the correct directory in production context.

## Deployment Details

**Deploy ID:** 690e65bbdcfd486ed75af217
**Unique URL:** <https://690e65bbdcfd486ed75af217--resonant-crostata-90b706.netlify.app>
**Production URL:** <https://whatismydelta.com>
**Time:** 2025-11-07 ~16:28

## Previous Deployment Result (Attempt #1)

**Deploy ID:** 690e63098529e76bc1cec4bb
**Result:** FAILED
**Errors:**

- `Uncaught ReferenceError: initApp is not defined` at (index):4015:49
- `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'appendChild')`
- Chat opens but does not function

## Current Status

**Deployment:** ✅ Completed
**CDN Upload:** ✅ 0 files changed (config-only change)
**CDN Propagation:** ⏳ Waiting (~60 seconds)

## Verification Required

**User must test in browser:**

1. **Hard refresh:** Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Open DevTools Console (F12)
3. Check: `typeof window.initApp`
   - Expected: `"function"`
4. Look for console errors:
   - Should NOT see: "initApp is not defined"
   - Should NOT see: "Cannot read properties of null"
5. Test chat:
   - Click chat button
   - Type message
   - Check if it sends (Network tab for /wimd request)

## Expected Outcome

If the `[context.production]` enforcement fixes a directory mismatch issue, we should see:

- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ `initApp` defined
- ✅ Chat functional

If errors persist, the issue is NOT a publish directory problem - it's something else in the code structure.

## Status

**Awaiting user browser verification.**

**DO NOT mark as successful until user confirms functionality works in browser.**
