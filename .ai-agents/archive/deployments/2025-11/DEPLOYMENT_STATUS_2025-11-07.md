## Deployment Executed

**Deploy ID:** 690e63098529e76bc1cec4bb
**URL:** <https://whatismydelta.com>
**Unique URL:** <https://690e63098529e76bc1cec4bb--resonant-crostata-90b706.netlify.app>
**Time:** 2025-11-07 ~16:10

## Automated Verification Results

### ✅ PASSED

- Site reachable
- Title correct
- Authentication UI present (11 references)
- PS101 flow present (43 references)
- Experiment components present (4 references)

### ⚠️ ANOMALY

- Line count mismatch: Expected 3989, Actual 4019
- Note: Local files are 4019 lines, verification script may have wrong expected value

### ✅ Code Features Detected in Production

- Safe footer year null-guard present
- Module-level `chatLog = null` present (line 1243)
- Phase 2.5 comments present
- All DOM timing fix code visible in HTML source

### ❓ UNVERIFIED (Requires Browser Testing)

- Does chat window open AND function?
- Do chat messages send to API?
- Does login/auth modal show?
- Are there console errors?
- Does `typeof window.initApp` return "function"?
- Do `[INIT] Phase 2.5` logs appear?

## BUILD_ID Note

Production shows: `BUILD_ID:6d8f2ed13cce0d75c2d94aae9c7814a515f80554|SHA:7795ae25`

This is the old BUILD_ID, but the CODE contains all fixes from commit `8d8d83f`. The BUILD_ID injection script may not have run, but the DOM timing fixes are definitely in the deployed HTML.

## Next Steps Required

**CRITICAL: Need user browser testing to confirm:**

1. Open <https://whatismydelta.com> in browser
2. Open DevTools Console (F12)
3. Check: `typeof window.initApp`
   - Expected: "function"
   - If "undefined": deployment failed
4. Look for console logs:
   - `[INIT] Phase 2.5: Initializing API check and chat...`
   - `[INIT] Phase 2.5 complete`
5. Test chat:
   - Click chat button
   - Does it open?
   - Type message
   - Does it send? (check Network tab for /wimd request)
6. Test login/auth:
   - Is login button/modal available?
7. Check for errors:
   - Any TypeError messages?
   - Any "Cannot set properties of null"?

## Status

**Deployment:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Code Verification:** ✅ DOM timing fixes present in HTML
**Functional Verification:** ⏳ AWAITING USER BROWSER TESTING

**DO NOT mark as successful until user confirms browser functionality works.**
