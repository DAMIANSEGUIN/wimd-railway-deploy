## Critical Issues to Address

**PRIORITY 1: Production Bug**

- Frontend only showing login screen after navigation
- Need to diagnose with CodexCapture logs
- Launch command: `/Applications/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium --user-data-dir=/Users/damianseguin/CodexChromiumProfile --load-extension=/Users/damianseguin/CodexTools/CodexCapture https://whatismydelta.com`

**PRIORITY 2: Governance Enforcement Crisis**

- Current governance cannot enforce itself
- AI agents systematically violate protocols
- Need to rewrite governance for external enforcement
- Details in: `.ai-agents/GOVERNANCE_FAILURE_ANALYSIS.md`

## Your Tasks

1. **Diagnose frontend login issue** (immediate)
2. **Read governance failure analysis**
3. **Rewrite governance for user/system enforcement**
4. **Create user enforcement checklist**
5. **Test that you can actually follow new governance**
