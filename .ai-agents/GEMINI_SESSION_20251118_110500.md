# Gemini Session Issue — 2025-11-18 11:05 UTC

**Current blocker:**  
- `./scripts/verify_critical_features.sh` warns that `API_BASE may not be using relative paths`.  
- The same script reports that the production site “may be missing authentication (or unreachable)”—a potential auth UI rendering gap.  
- `./Mosaic/PS101_Continuity_Kit/check_spec_hash.sh` confirmed `SPEC_SHA 7795ae25` matches the deploy log, so the build hash is healthy.

We need Gemini to focus on the live production warnings:
1. Trace the `API_BASE` configuration across `frontend/index.html`, `mosaic_ui/index.html`, and any env scripts to ensure we’re using the relative `/wimd` endpoint in builds instead of absolute URLs.
2. Confirm the authentication UI elements are rendering (or explain why the check warns they might be missing), ideally by mapping the warning to concrete DOM references or network calls.
3. Capture any evidence (logs, lines of code, config values) that fix or explain these warnings so Claude can document them in the URGENT deployment note.

Once we have the investigation output, we can decide whether a tactical fix is needed or the warning can be documented and resolved later. This issue note should be shared with Gemini right after the workflow doc to keep context focused.
