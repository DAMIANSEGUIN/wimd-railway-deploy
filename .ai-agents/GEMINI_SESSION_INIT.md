Gemini, here's the quick context you need before we do anything: Mosaic is a Next.js/React site deployed from `/Users/damianseguin/AI_Workspace/WIMD-Railway-Deploy-Project` (Netlify + Railway). Right now `./scripts/verify_critical_features.sh` warns `API_BASE` is not relative and the prod auth UI may be missing, so focus on those files/logs. Read `/Users/damianseguin/AI_Workspace/WIMD-Railway-Deploy-Project/.ai-agents/GEMINI_CLI_WORKFLOW.md`, `/Users/damianseguin/AI_Workspace/WIMD-Railway-Deploy-Project/.ai-agents/GEMINI_CONTEXT_BRIEF.md`, and `/Users/damianseguin/AI_Workspace/WIMD-Railway-Deploy-Project/.ai-agents/GEMINI_SESSION_20251118_110500.md` before proposing anything. Do not run commands yourself—give me the exact zsh commands to execute, and I’ll paste the outputs back so you can reason over them.
