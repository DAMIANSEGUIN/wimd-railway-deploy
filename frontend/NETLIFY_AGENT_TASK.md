## Task 1: Draggable/Resizable Windows

**Goal**: Allow users to drag and resize windows/panels on the Mosaic site.

**Implementation**:

1. Create new component: `src/components/DraggableWindow.jsx`
   - Full code provided in `docs/specs/mosaic_draggable_windows_spec.md`
   - Import `react-draggable` and `re-resizable`

2. Wrap PS101 coaching steps in `<DraggableWindow>` component
   - Find existing PS101 step components
   - Wrap each step in the new DraggableWindow component
   - Set appropriate default positions and sizes

3. Add features:
   - Z-index management (clicked window comes to front)
   - Mobile detection (disable dragging on screens <768px)
   - Minimum window sizes (300px × 200px)
   - Bounded dragging (windows stay within viewport)

**Test**:

- Windows drag smoothly when clicking header
- Windows resize from corners
- Windows don't disappear off-screen
- Works on desktop browsers
- Gracefully disabled on mobile

## Task 2: Google Calendar Booking Integration

**Goal**: Add appointment booking link for users to schedule coaching sessions.

**Booking URL**: `https://calendar.app.google/EAnDSz2CcTtH849x6`

**Implementation** (choose one):

### Option A: Simple Link (Recommended for Phase 1)

Add a button/link that opens booking page in new tab.

**Where to add**:

- PS101 results page (after completing coaching flow)
- User dashboard (if exists)

**Code**:

```jsx
<a
  href="https://calendar.app.google/EAnDSz2CcTtH849x6"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
  className="book-session-button"
>
  Book a Coaching Session
</a>
```

### Option B: Embedded iframe (Better UX)

Embed booking directly in the site.

**Code**:

```jsx
<iframe
  src="https://calendar.app.google/EAnDSz2CcTtH849x6"
  width="100%"
  height="600px"
  frameBorder="0"
  title="Book a Coaching Session"
/>
```

**Test**:

- Link opens to Google Calendar appointment page
- User can successfully book appointment
- No console errors
