# OSINT Forensics Guide for Values-Driven Job Search

## Overview

The OSINT Forensics Engine provides deep intelligence analysis of companies through job postings, focused on **values alignment** and **passion opportunities** for Mosaic users. This system analyzes job postings to understand what companies really value, their culture, and how well they align with your personal values and passions.

## Core Philosophy: Values-Driven Job Search

Unlike traditional job search that focuses on skills and experience, Mosaic's OSINT forensics focuses on:

1. **Values Alignment**: Does this company share your values?
2. **Passion Opportunities**: Can you pursue your passions here?
3. **Cultural Fit**: Will you thrive in their culture?
4. **Growth Potential**: Do they invest in areas you care about?
