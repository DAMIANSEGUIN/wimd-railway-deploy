**Version:** v2.0
**Status:** Core Implementation Complete

---

## Overview

This document summarizes the PS101 v2 implementation, including the 10-step canonical flow and Small Experiments Framework integration.

## Implementation Scope

### ✅ Completed Features

#### 1. Core PS101 v2 Structure

- **10-step canonical flow** (replaced 7-step version)
  - Step 1: Problem Identification and Delta Analysis (6 prompts)
  - Step 2: Current Situation Analysis (4 prompts)
  - Step 3: Root Cause Exploration (4 prompts)
  - Step 4: Self-Efficacy Assessment (4 prompts)
  - Step 5: Solution Brainstorming (4 prompts)
  - Step 6: Experimental Design (4 prompts + Experiment Canvas)
  - Step 7: Obstacle Identification (4 prompts + Obstacle Mapping)
  - Step 8: Action Planning (4 prompts + Action Plan)
  - Step 9: Reflection and Iteration (4 prompts + Reflection Log)
  - Step 10: Building Mastery and Self-Efficacy (4 prompts)

- **Multi-prompt UI pattern**
  - Shows one prompt at a time
  - Progress indicator: "Prompt X of Y"
  - Collapsible previous prompts view
  - Smooth navigation between prompts

#### 2. State Management (v2)

- **New localStorage key:** `ps101_v2_state`
- **State structure:**

  ```javascript
  {
    currentStep: 1-10,
    currentPromptIndex: 0-n,
    steps: {
      "1": { prompts: [{response: "...", completedAt: "..."}] }
    },
    experiments: [/* experiment objects */],
    startedAt: "ISO date",
    lastUpdated: "ISO date",
    completed: false,
    completionScores: {}
  }
  ```

- **Migration:** Automatic migration from v1 (`ps101_state`) to v2

#### 3. Small Experiments Framework

- **Experiment Canvas (Step 6)**
  - Hypothesis field
  - Success metric
  - Start/review dates
  - Resources/support needed
  - Auto-save functionality

- **Obstacle Mapping (Step 7)**
  - Add/remove obstacles
  - External/internal tagging
  - Mitigation strategies
  - Visual distinction (colors)

- **Action Plan (Step 8)**
  - Checklist with checkboxes
  - Due dates
  - Accountability assignments
  - Progress tracking

- **Reflection Log (Step 9)**
  - Outcomes textarea
  - Learning summary
  - Confidence slider (1-10) with before/after comparison
  - Next move selection (Continue/Pivot/Archive)

#### 4. Experiment State Management

- `createExperiment()` - Creates new experiment
- `getActiveExperiment()` - Returns current active experiment
- `updateExperiment(id, updates)` - Updates experiment fields
- `addObstacle(id, obstacle)` - Adds obstacle to experiment
- `addAction(id, action)` - Adds action to experiment
- `updateReflection(id, reflection)` - Saves reflection data

#### 5. Validation Rules

- **Multi-prompt validation:**
  - Step 1, prompt 1: Minimum 50 chars, requires 2+ sentences
  - Step 5, prompt 1: Minimum 100 chars
  - All other prompts: Minimum 30 chars

- **Experiment validation:**
  - Step 6: Requires hypothesis, success metric, and at least one date
  - Step 7: Requires at least one obstacle with strategy
  - Step 8: Requires at least 3 action items
  - Step 9: Requires outcome, learning, and confidence score

#### 6. UI/UX Enhancements

- Progress indicator shows all 10 steps
- Prompt-by-prompt navigation
- Auto-save indicators
- Previous answers collapsible view
- Experiment components styled with Peripheral Calm aesthetic

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

- `frontend/index.html` - Main implementation file
  - Lines 1731-1855: PS101_STEPS array (10 steps)
  - Lines 1857-2156: PS101State object (v2 structure)
  - Lines 476-546: Experiment components HTML
  - Lines 179-208: Experiment components CSS
  - Lines 2518-2698: Experiment rendering functions
  - Lines 2958-3057: Experiment event listeners

### Key Functions Added

- `renderExperimentCanvas(experiment)` - Renders Step 6 canvas
- `renderObstacleMapping(experiment)` - Renders Step 7 obstacles
- `renderActionPlan(experiment)` - Renders Step 8 action checklist
- `renderReflectionLog(experiment)` - Renders Step 9 reflection form

### Data Flow

1. User answers prompts → Saved to `steps[stepNum].prompts[promptIndex]`
2. On Step 6+ last prompt → Experiment component shown
3. User fills experiment fields → Auto-saved to `experiments[]` array
4. Navigation validation → Checks both prompt answers AND experiment data

## Remaining Work (Per TODOs)

### High Priority

- [ ] **Mastery Dashboard (Step 10)** - Aggregated view of journey
- [ ] **Completion Screen Updates** - Show experiment summary
- [ ] **Backend Sync** - Extend `/wimd/ask` pipeline for experiments

### Peripheral Calm Enhancements (Post-Day-1)

- [ ] Delta visualization (Step 1)
- [ ] Explore/Exploit tagging (Step 5)
- [ ] Contextual coaching nudges
- [ ] Resource suggestions panel
- [ ] Journey rail mapping

### Testing & Polish

- [ ] Regression testing (metrics, chat, uploads, auth)
- [ ] Accessibility audit
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verification

---

## Migration Path

### From v1 to v2

- Automatic detection of `ps101_state`
- Migration converts `answers` object to `steps` structure
- Old state preserved during migration
- New state saved to `ps101_v2_state`

### Rollback Plan

- Previous state stored in `ps101_state` (if exists)
- Can revert to v1 by switching localStorage key

---

## Testing Checklist

## Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Experiment forms** - Currently use browser prompts/alerts for adding obstacles/actions (could be improved with modal dialogs)
2. **Step 10** - Mastery Dashboard not yet implemented
3. **Backend sync** - Experiments array not yet synced to backend
4. **Date pickers** - Basic HTML5 date inputs (may need fallback for older browsers)

---

## Code Quality Notes

- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ Consistent code style
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Accessibility considerations (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- ⚠️ Some typos fixed during implementation (encoding issues)

## Next Steps for Team Review

1. **Functional Review**
   - Test complete flow end-to-end
   - Verify experiment data structure
   - Check validation rules

2. **Code Review**
   - Review state management approach
   - Evaluate experiment component structure
   - Check for optimization opportunities

3. **UX Review**
   - Test multi-prompt flow
   - Evaluate experiment component usability
   - Check mobile responsiveness

4. **Integration Planning**
   - Plan backend sync for experiments
   - Design Mastery Dashboard
   - Prioritize Peripheral Calm enhancements
