# 📋 Project Plan Adjustments - Review Request

**To:** Cursor + Codex + Team
**From:** Claude Code (Troubleshooting SSE)
**Date:** 2025-10-31 (Updated with Codex corrections)
**Re:** Critical action items from PS101 v2 review + Codex operational notes

### ✅ Latest Update (2025-10-31)

**Codex corrections applied** to main document:

- Fixed non-existent test/script references
- Marked TODOs for net-new work (validate_data_quality.py, rotate_api_key.sh)
- Corrected OPERATIONS_MANUAL to expand existing section (not create duplicate)

**All references now point to real, actionable files.**

## 📄 Document to Review

**`docs/PROJECT_PLAN_ADJUSTMENTS.md`**

This consolidated action plan integrates:

- ✅ Claude Code's PS101 v2 technical review findings
- ✅ Codex's operational gap analysis
- ✅ Updated checklists with ownership assignments
- ✅ Decision points requiring team discussion

---

## 🎯 Key Points to Review

### 1. **PS101 v2 Status** (Section 1)

- ✅ Code complete, matches canonical spec
- 🚨 **3 blocking issues** need 2.5-4 hours to fix before deployment
- 📋 Detailed fixes documented in `docs/CURSOR_FIXES_REQUIRED.md`

**Owner:** Cursor
**Deadline:** 2025-11-01

### 2. **Operational Gaps** (Section 2)

Three critical documentation gaps identified:

**Gap #1: Checklist Ownership**

- SHARE_WITH_MOSAIC_TEAM.md has all items unchecked
- No owners, no deadlines, unclear status
- **Owner:** Codex | **Deadline:** 2025-11-01

**Gap #2: API Key Management**

- No rotation process documented
- No security/revocation procedure
- **Owner:** Codex | **Deadline:** 2025-11-02

**Gap #3: Success Metrics Validation**

- Claims <2s response, >90% quality, >99% uptime
- No measurement methodology defined
- **Owner:** Codex | **Deadline:** 2025-11-02

### 3. **Action Plan** (Section 3)

Phased approach with owners and deadlines:

**Phase 1 (This Week):** Unblock deployment + close critical gaps

- Total: ~7-10 hours across team

**Phase 2 (Next Sprint):** Complete features + strengthen operations

- Total: ~30 hours

**Phase 3 (Sprint 3):** Full maturity

- Total: ~40+ hours

### 4. **Decision Points** (Section 6)

**4 decisions needed from Damian:**

1. **Inline forms vs modals** for obstacle/action collection
   - Recommendation: Inline forms (faster)
   - Needed by: 2025-11-01

2. **Step 10 timeline**: Deploy with placeholder vs wait for full dashboard?
   - Recommendation: Placeholder now, full dashboard Sprint 2
   - Needed by: 2025-11-01

3. **Operations doc ownership**: Who maintains going forward?
   - Recommendation: Shared (Codex process, Cursor technical)
   - Needed by: 2025-11-02

4. **Monitoring tool**: Render only vs Sentry vs custom dashboard?
   - Recommendation: Render + enhanced /health + Uptime Robot (free)
   - Needed by: 2025-11-05

### 5. **Risk Assessment** (Section 7)

**High-risk items flagged:**

- 🚨 PS101 v2 prompt() dialogs (UX/accessibility issue)
- 🚨 No API key rotation plan (security risk)
- 🚨 Web scraping untested (user-facing features may break)
- 🚨 No monitoring = can't detect outages

### 6. **Updated Checklists with Ownership** (Section 5)

All checklists now have:

- ✅ Current status (Done / In Progress / Not Started)
- 👤 Owner assignments
- 📅 Deadlines
- 🔗 Dependencies

---

## ✅ Immediate Next Actions

## 📊 Critical Path

**To unblock PS101 v2 deployment:**

```
Day 1 (2025-11-01):
├─ Cursor: Fix 3 blocking issues (2.5-4h)
├─ Cursor: Run testing checklist (1-2h)
├─ Codex: Assign checklist owners (30m)
└─ Damian: Make decisions + approve fixes (30m)

Day 2 (2025-11-02):
├─ Cursor: Deploy to production (30m)
├─ Codex: Document API key management (1h)
├─ Codex: Define metrics validation (1-2h)
└─ Team: Monitor logs for 24 hours
```

**Total blocking work:** 7-10 hours
