I've received Mosaic MCP v1.1 files for potential integration into our governance architecture. This represents a fundamental change from file-based context management to MCP server-based memory and supervisor agent coordination. Claude Code has completed due diligence and created a comprehensive integration plan with identified conflicts, risks, and open questions. **DO NOT IMPLEMENT** anything yet - this is a review phase only. Please read the full team review summary at `docs/MCP_V1_1_TEAM_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md` and provide your concerns, questions, and recommendations before we proceed.
