## Current State Analysis

### Restored Version (6e026fa)

**Source:** railway-origin/main
**Line Count:** 2,766 lines
**Title:** "What Is My Delta — Clean Interface"

**Features Present:**

- ✅ Authentication: 7 authModal references
- ✅ PS101 flow: 39 PS101State references
- ✅ API_BASE: Empty string (correct)
- ❓ Small Experiments Framework: NEEDS VERIFICATION
- ❓ Inline forms (PS101-FIX-001): NEEDS VERIFICATION
- ❓ All 10 PS101 steps: NEEDS VERIFICATION

**Features Potentially Missing:**

- ❌ PS101 v2 enhancements (3,427 line version had improvements)
- ❌ Enhanced inline forms from PS101-FIX-001
- ❌ Experiment components HTML/CSS
- ❌ Multi-prompt micro-step pattern

---

## Spec Comparison Required

### Need to Check

1. Does current version have all 10 PS101 steps?
2. Does it have multi-prompt experience per step?
3. Does it have Small Experiments Framework components?
4. Does it have inline forms or browser prompts?
5. Does it match PS101_CANONICAL_SPEC_V2.md requirements?

### Files to Compare

- Current: `mosaic_ui/index.html` (2,766 lines)
- PS101 v2: Commit 890d2bc (3,427 lines)
- Spec: `docs/PS101_CANONICAL_SPEC_V2.md`
- Task Brief: `docs/PS101_FIX_PROMPTS_TASK_BRIEF.md`

---

## Decision Point

### Option A: Deploy Current (2,766 lines)

**Pros:**

- ✅ Auth working immediately
- ✅ PS101 flow functional
- ✅ Known stable version

**Cons:**

- ❌ May be missing PS101 v2 enhancements
- ❌ May still have browser prompts (not inline forms)
- ❌ May not have complete Small Experiments Framework
- ❌ Doesn't match latest spec

**Risk:** Deploying incomplete version that doesn't meet PS101_CANONICAL_SPEC_V2 requirements

### Option B: Merge PS101 v2 Features into Current

**Pros:**

- ✅ Gets both auth AND PS101 v2 enhancements
- ✅ Meets full spec requirements
- ✅ Includes inline forms (PS101-FIX-001)

**Cons:**

- ❌ Requires manual feature extraction
- ❌ More testing needed
- ⏱️ Takes more time

**Risk:** Introducing bugs during merge

### Option C: Verify Current First, Then Enhance

**Pros:**

- ✅ Deploys working auth immediately
- ✅ Establishes stable baseline
- ✅ Can add enhancements incrementally

**Cons:**

- ⏱️ Delayed full spec compliance
- ❌ Multiple deployments needed

**Risk:** User sees less-polished version first

---

## Recommended Action

**STOP DEPLOYMENT until:**

1. ✅ Verify current version has all MUST HAVE features
2. ✅ Compare against PS101_CANONICAL_SPEC_V2.md line by line
3. ✅ Document spec gaps in current version
4. ✅ Get approval on which features are deployment blockers
5. ✅ Make informed decision: Deploy current vs. enhance first

**Next Steps:**

1. Check if current version has all 10 PS101 steps with multi-prompts
2. Check if Small Experiments Framework is complete
3. Check if inline forms are present (not browser prompts)
4. If gaps found, assess severity and decide on deployment approach
