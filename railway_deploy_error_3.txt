DEPLOY LOGS (Runtime Error - Still occurring):
----------------------------------------------
Importing the numpy C-extensions failed. This error can happen for
many reasons, often due to issues with your setup or how NumPy was
installed.

We have compiled some common reasons and troubleshooting tips at:
https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/troubleshooting-importerror.html

Please note and check the following:

* The Python version is: Python 3.11 from "/root/.nix-profile/bin/python"
* The NumPy version is: "2.4.0"

and make sure that they are the versions you expect.

Original error was: libstdc++.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

[2026-01-05 19:59:33 +0000] [4] [INFO] Worker exiting (pid: 4)
[2026-01-05 19:59:33 +0000] [1] [ERROR] Worker (pid:4) exited with code 3

[2026-01-05 19:59:33 +0000] [1] [ERROR] Reason: Worker failed to boot.

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
The C++ standard library fix didn't work. The packages "gcc" and "stdenv.cc.cc.lib"
didn't provide libstdc++.so.6 in the runtime environment.

SOLUTION:
---------
Need to use correct Nix packages for the C++ runtime library.
Try: libstdcxx5 or gccStdenv or set LD_LIBRARY_PATH
