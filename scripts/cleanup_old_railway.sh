# Guarded cleanup helper for old Railway resources.
# This script DOES NOT silently delete anything. It:
# - Shows the currently linked project/service (if accessible)
# - Lets you unlink the repo from a project
# - Lets you delete an environment (with confirmation)
# - Lets you roll back the most recent deployment (railway down)
# - Opens the Railway dashboard for manual project/service deletion
#
# Note: Some destructive operations (deleting services/projects) are not
# exposed via all Railway CLI versions; use the dashboard for those.
