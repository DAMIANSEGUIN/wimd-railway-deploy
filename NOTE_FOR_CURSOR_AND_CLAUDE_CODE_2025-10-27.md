## Codex Update – 2025-11-03

Recent hardening items are in place:

- `.githooks/pre-push` holds the enforcement hook under version control. Run `./scripts/setup_hooks.sh` (or `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`) after cloning to activate it.
- `scripts/push.sh` now honors `SKIP_VERIFICATION=true`, delegating logging to the hook so emergency bypass guidance matches runtime behavior.
- `.github/workflows/deploy-verification.yml` no longer auto-reverts `main`; failures stop and instruct human-led rollback, avoiding history damage.
- Workflow deploy step updated to pass `--auth`/`--site` flags so Netlify CLI uses repo secrets without interactive login.
- Documentation (checklist, CLAUDE.md, enforcement plan, implementation report) updated to reflect the tracked hook, setup script, and manual rollback flow.

Still outstanding:

1. Confirm `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` runs successfully everywhere (local run succeeded once `.git/config` was unlocked).
2. Perform a live `./scripts/push.sh railway-origin main` when network/credentials allow, to exercise hook + audit logging end-to-end.
3. Re-run the GitHub Action after secrets are loaded to validate the manual escalation messaging.

Codex can rerun the full audit checklist once those confirmations are complete or if additional guardrails are desired.

## PS101 QA Mode – 2025-11-17

Browser-based testing no longer requires babysitting the 5-minute trial timer:

- Run `node scripts/reset_ps101_trial.mjs` to enable QA mode, clear the old trial timestamp, and reload the live site with an “infinite” trial. The script accepts `--off` to disable the override and `--no-reset` to keep the current timestamp. Add `--url <env>` to target staging URLs.
- The frontend now reads `localStorage.ps101_force_trial`; when it’s set to `"true"` the trial never expires (see `frontend/index.html` & `mosaic_ui/index.html`). This is local-only and safe to leave enabled on dev machines.
- Manual fallback: execute `localStorage.setItem('ps101_force_trial','true')` and `localStorage.removeItem('ps101_trial_start')` in DevTools, then refresh.

Remember to disable the override (`node scripts/reset_ps101_trial.mjs --off`) before doing any real end-to-end auth checks so production-like behavior is restored.

## Note to Claude_Code – 2025-11-03

Codex went ahead with the enforcement roll-out while you were offline:

- Hook enforcement moved under version control (`.githooks/pre-push`) with `scripts/setup_hooks.sh` to set `core.hooksPath`. Docs/checklists updated so every environment installs the hook.
- Wrapper scripts now align with bypass guidance; `SKIP_VERIFICATION=true` skips local checks while the hook logs the bypass.
- GitHub Action deploy step uses repo secrets via `--auth/--site`, and auto-revert logic was removed in favor of manual escalation.
- Verification scripts and docs were left intact; the line-count/title guard still asserts PS101-ready content (currently failing because production serves the lean UI).

Testing covered:
1. Pre-push verification (blocking on dirty trees).
2. Wrapper behavior (bypass path verified locally despite sandboxed network).
3. GitHub Action run up to Netlify deploy—fails at `verify_live_deployment.sh` because the live site serves the older frontend.

Outstanding for production deploy:
1. Ensure `.githooks` installation on any machine you use (`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`).
2. Redeploy the PS101-ready bundle so `verify_live_deployment.sh` passes (current prod title is “What Is My Delta — Clean Interface”).
3. Re-run the “Deployment Verification” workflow; expect it to pass once the new bundle is live.

Codex can help prep diffs or tweak verification thresholds if needed; deployment remains pending your go-ahead.
