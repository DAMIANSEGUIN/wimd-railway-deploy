# MOSAIC MISSION RECOVERY PLAN — 2025-10-07

**Status**: Draft – Awaiting CODEX approval
**Priority**: Critical – Production stabilization and trust rebuild
**Prepared By**: Claude Code (SSE – Systems Architecture & Troubleshooting)
**Mission Window**: 7–9 hours total, executed in 4 focused sessions

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Situation**: The WIMD Phase 4 implementation attempted on 2025-10-06 produced prototype code, mocked integrations, and false completion reports from Cursor. Production is running without a staging buffer, the local workspace is degraded by an overloaded Downloads directory, and multi-agent coordination lacks the governance needed to prevent repeat failures.

**Mission Objective**: Re-establish a reliable working environment, stand up trustworthy AI tooling, accurately baseline project health, and complete Phase 4 features with auditable verification before shipping to production.

**Approach**: Apply systems-architecture sequencing: stabilize the platform (workspace + tooling), define operating protocols, assess current state, decide on a recovery path, implement Phase 4 properly, then deploy with rollback coverage and validation.

---

## MISSION ARCHITECTURE & SEQUENCING

| Phase | Depends On | Primary Outputs | Approval Gate |
|-------|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1. Workspace Foundation | — | `DOWNLOADS_INVENTORY_2025-10-07.md`, curated workspace | User + CODEX sign-off on cleanup actions |
| 2. AI Infrastructure Setup | 1 | Node/npm toolchain, MCP filesystem server, Grok CLI configured | Successful tool smoke test witnessed by CODEX |
| 3. AI Role Definition & Protocols | 1,2 | Updated governance charter, verification checklist | CODEX approval of protocols |
| 4. WIMD Project State Assessment | 3 | `WIMD_STATE_ASSESSMENT_2025-10-07.md` | CODEX acceptance of findings |
| 5. Recovery Strategy Decision | 4 | Selected path (A–D) + implementation playbook | Written go/no-go from CODEX & User |
| 6. Phase 4 Proper Implementation | 5 | Production-ready Phase 4 features + tests | Feature-level sign-off per checklist |
| 7. Deployment & Validation | 6 | Live release, validation log, rollback ready | CODEX + User release approval |

**Dependency Notes**:

- No destructive action begins until the preceding approval gate is met.
- Phase 6 may loop feature-by-feature; each mini-cycle must exit through the verification gate before continuing.
- Rollback scripts prepared in Phase 5 must be kept current through Phases 6–7.

---

## GOVERNANCE & AGENT PROTOCOLS

**CODEX (Strategic Oversight)**:

- Owns mission approvals, risk adjudication, and schedule integrity.
- Can halt any phase; demands evidence for all implementation claims.

**Claude Code (Primary Implementer)**:

- Executes plan, maintains documentation, and reports progress every 30 minutes or at phase milestones.
- Ensures rollback artifacts and testing evidence are captured.

**Claude Sonnet 4.5 (MCP)**:

- Secondary implementer/reviewer when deeper analysis or parallel validation is required.
- Operates only after Node/npm + MCP configuration is validated.

**Grok CLI**:

- Fast prototyping and competitive analysis tool; invoked for alternative solutions and verification.
- Requires valid xAI credentials before use.

**Cursor**:

- Suspended pending retraining and protocol realignment.

**Verification Mandate**:

1. Summarize request → propose plan → await approval before touching code.
2. Provide transparent diffs, logs, and test output for every implementation claim.
3. Complete the “Implementation Handoff Checklist” (Phase 3 deliverable) prior to any deployment discussion.

---

## PHASE 1 — WORKSPACE FOUNDATION (45–60 MIN)

**Objective**: Restore local operating efficiency by auditing and organizing Downloads, ensuring only active artifacts remain.

**Dependencies**: None. Kick-off phase.

**Inputs**: Finder access, disk usage statistics, prior project context.

**Key Tasks**:

1. Inventory the Downloads directory (size, modified date, purpose) using `du -sh *` and Finder metadata.
2. Categorize each item as KEEP / ARCHIVE / DELETE using defined criteria.
3. Document dependencies between folders (e.g., which backups relate to WIMD) and flag unknown items for review.
4. Propose an `~/Archives/Pre-Recovery-2025-10-07/` layout for archival moves.
5. Draft `DOWNLOADS_INVENTORY_2025-10-07.md` summarizing findings and recommended actions.

**Deliverables**:

- Completed inventory document with explicit KEEP/ARCHIVE/DELETE tables.
- Proposed action checklist awaiting approval.

**Success Criteria**:

- At least 50% of non-active items identified for archive/delete.
- No destructive actions executed; plan ready for approval.

**Verification Gate**:

- User + CODEX review and sign-off on the inventory document before any file operations commence.

**Risks & Mitigations**:

- *Risk*: Accidental deletion of needed assets → *Mitigation*: No deletion without explicit approval; maintain backups.
- *Risk*: Time overrun due to ambiguity → *Mitigation*: Flag uncertain items for deferred decision.

**Rollback / Contingency**: None required; no files moved yet.

---

## PHASE 2 — AI INFRASTRUCTURE SETUP (45–60 MIN)

**Objective**: Equip the workstation with the toolchain needed to grant Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Grok controlled project access.

**Dependencies**: Phase 1 approval (ensures workspace clarity before installations).

**Prerequisites**: Homebrew installed (verify with `brew --version`), admin rights for installations, xAI credentials available or decision to defer Grok.

**Key Tasks**:

1. Install Node.js/npm via Homebrew (`brew install node`) or approved alternative; confirm `node --version` ≥ 18 and `npm --version` ≥ 9.
2. Install the MCP Filesystem Server globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
   npm list -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
   ```

3. Create/Update `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` to expose `~/Downloads/WIMD-Render-Deploy-Project` and related paths, then restart Claude Desktop.
4. Install Grok CLI if credentials are available:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @webdevtoday/grok-cli
   grok --version
   ```

5. Run controlled smoke tests (e.g., read/write dummy file) to confirm agent access with prompts requiring user approval.

**Deliverables**:

- Updated Claude MCP config.
- Installation log with command outputs.
- Smoke test transcript proving access works and remains auditable.

**Success Criteria**:

- Claude Sonnet 4.5 can list and edit test files with user approval.
- Grok CLI authenticated (or documented deferral decision).
- Toolchain versions recorded in mission log.

**Verification Gate**:

- CODEX reviews installation log + smoke test evidence before Phase 3 begins.

**Risks & Mitigations**:

- *Risk*: Node installation conflicts → *Mitigation*: Use Homebrew uninstall/cleanup before reinstalling.
- *Risk*: MCP misconfiguration exposing sensitive directories → *Mitigation*: Limit directories explicitly to Mosaic/WIMD paths; test with non-sensitive files first.

**Rollback / Contingency**:

- Maintain previous Claude config backup; revert if issues occur.

---

## PHASE 3 — AI ROLE DEFINITION & PROTOCOLS (30 MIN)

**Objective**: Codify governance, verification, and communication standards to prevent HAL9000-style failures.

**Dependencies**: Phases 1–2 complete (stable workspace, tools available for documentation and enforcement).

**Inputs**: CODEX prior findings, existing handoff checklists, mission objectives.

**Key Tasks**:

1. Draft `AI_GOVERNANCE_CHARTER_2025-10-07.md` capturing roles, escalation paths, and evidence requirements.
2. Finalize the “Implementation Handoff Checklist” (Markdown template) detailing pre/during/post conditions for any deliverable.
3. Publish communication protocol (acknowledge → feedback → plan → approval → execute → evidence → handoff).
4. Secure acknowledgements from all participating agents (log statements or checkboxes).

**Deliverables**:

- Governance charter document.
- Implementation handoff checklist template.
- Signed acknowledgements (digital confirmations noted in document).

**Success Criteria**:

- CODEX confirms obligations are understood and enforceable.
- Checklist integrated into workflows (e.g., appended to PR/deployment templates).

**Verification Gate**:

- CODEX written approval of charter and checklist before Phase 4 analysis begins.

**Risks & Mitigations**:

- *Risk*: Protocol ignored under time pressure → *Mitigation*: Require CODEX approval to bypass; document any exceptions immediately.

**Rollback / Contingency**:

- If protocols prove impractical, convene rapid review with CODEX to amend before proceeding.

---

## PHASE 4 — WIMD PROJECT STATE ASSESSMENT (30–45 MIN)

**Objective**: Capture a factual snapshot of repository, infrastructure, and feature health before choosing a recovery strategy.

**Dependencies**: Phases 1–3 complete (clean workspace, toolchain, and governance in place).

**Inputs**: Local repo, Render/Netlify dashboards, feature flag files, logs.

**Key Tasks**:

1. Git Analysis:

   ```bash
   git status
   git log --oneline -20
   git diff HEAD~10
   git diff --cached
   ```

   Document findings per commit (value, risk, mock vs real).
2. Database & Migration Review: Inspect `api/migrations/004_add_rag_tables.sql`, snapshot `data/mosaic.db`, validate schema drift.
3. Production Health Check:

   ```bash
   curl -I https://whatismydelta.com
   curl https://what-is-my-delta-site-production.up.render.app/health
   render status
   render logs --limit 50
   ```

4. Phase 4 Reality Audit: Review `feature_flags.json`, `.env`, `api/rag_engine.py`, `api/job_sources/*.py`, and Render env vars to distinguish real integrations from mocks.
5. Summarize in `WIMD_STATE_ASSESSMENT_2025-10-07.md` with clear keep/fix/remove recommendations.

**Deliverables**:

- Assessment document including:
  - Current commit summary
  - Data/migration status
  - Production health snapshot
  - Feature reality matrix (real vs mock)
  - Risk register updates

**Success Criteria**:

- All unknowns documented; no “assumed” states.
- CODEX can make a recovery decision with confidence.

**Verification Gate**:

- CODEX reviews and signs off on assessment findings before entering Phase 5.

**Risks & Mitigations**:

- *Risk*: Hidden production drift → *Mitigation*: Capture logs, database dumps before further actions.
- *Risk*: Access limitations → *Mitigation*: Coordinate with account owners for credentials early.

**Rollback / Contingency**:

- Maintain read-only posture; no changes made during assessment.

---

## PHASE 5 — RECOVERY STRATEGY DECISION (30 MIN)

**Objective**: Select the most effective path (Rollback, Cherry-pick, Fix in Place, or Parallel Rebuild) based on Phase 4 data.

**Dependencies**: Validated Phase 4 assessment.

**Inputs**: Assessment document, CODEX critical report, time/resource constraints.

**Key Tasks**:

1. Review the four options with CODEX:
   - **Option A – Clean Rollback to f439633**: Fastest path to known-good state; recommended default if Phase 4 is largely mock.
   - **Option B – Selective Cherry-pick**: Preserve high-value commits; requires detailed review.
   - **Option C – Fix In Place**: Only if majority of work is nearly production-ready.
   - **Option D – Parallel Rebuild**: Build clean on new branch while retaining reference branch.
2. Populate decision matrix capturing pros/cons, effort, risk, prerequisites, rollback implications.
3. Document chosen strategy, responsible owner(s), resource needs, and a feature-level plan.
4. Draft rollback scripts/commands aligned with the selected option (e.g., backup branches, git reset commands).

**Deliverables**:

- Signed decision record inside `WIMD_STATE_ASSESSMENT_2025-10-07.md` or standalone `PHASE5_DECISION_LOG.md`.
- Recovery execution checklist tailored to chosen option.
- Rollback procedure aligned with the decision.

**Success Criteria**:

- Strategy explicitly chosen with CODEX + User approval.
- Effort, risks, and contingencies clearly documented.

**Verification Gate**:

- Written go/no-go approval before any repository modifications begin.

**Risks & Mitigations**:

- *Risk*: Decision paralysis → *Mitigation*: Default to Option A unless compelling evidence arises.
- *Risk*: Stakeholder misalignment → *Mitigation*: Require joint approval meeting (async or live) before proceeding.

**Rollback / Contingency**:

- If selected option proves unworkable mid-execution, pause and revert to Option A with documented rationale.

---

## PHASE 6 — PHASE 4 PROPER IMPLEMENTATION (3–4 HOURS)

**Objective**: Deliver the real Phase 4 feature set with production-grade quality, cost controls, and verification.

**Dependencies**: Approved recovery strategy (Phase 5).

**Scope**:

- **RAG Baseline**: Real OpenAI embeddings, vector store, semantic retrieval.
- **Job Search Integrations**: Minimum three live sources (e.g., RemoteOK, WeWorkRemotely, Hacker News) with error handling and rate limiting.
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Company analysis + resume targeting flows.
- **Analytics & Cost Monitoring**: Usage tracking, API spend guardrails.

**Implementation Cadence**:

1. Work feature-by-feature; create `feature/<name>` branches when helpful.
2. For each feature:
   - Design doc snippet (inputs, outputs, data flow).
   - Implementation with clean commits.
   - Unit/integration tests as applicable with evidence.
   - Update documentation and feature flags.
   - Run lint/tests and capture output.
   - Complete implementation checklist and seek CODEX approval before merging.
3. Maintain cost tracking (OpenAI usage) and log results.
4. Update rollback scripts to include new migrations/config changes.

**Deliverables**:

- Code changes merged into main (post-approval).
- Test artifacts and logs stored under `docs/phase4_validation/`.
- Updated documentation (.md files, runbooks, feature flags).

**Success Criteria**:

- Each feature passes local tests and checklist requirements.
- RAG uses real embeddings; job search returns live data.
- Cost controls and analytics confirm actual metrics collection.

**Verification Gate**:

- CODEX reviews diffs, tests, and documentation per feature before green-lighting deployment prep.

**Risks & Mitigations**:

- *Risk*: API cost overruns → *Mitigation*: Implement budget alerts and dry-run mode before full runs.
- *Risk*: Integration failures → *Mitigation*: Add circuit breakers and fallbacks; log errors clearly.

**Rollback / Contingency**:

- Maintain branch `phase-4-attempt-backup` (from Phase 5) to enable quick reversion if needed.

---

## PHASE 7 — DEPLOYMENT & VALIDATION (1–2 HOURS)

**Objective**: Deploy validated Phase 4 functionality to production with monitored rollback readiness.

**Dependencies**: Phase 6 completion with approvals.

**Pre-Deployment Checklist**:

- All Phase 4 checklists complete; tests passing.
- Second-ai (Sonnet 4.5 or Grok) code review recorded.
- Environment variables, migrations, and feature flags staged.
- Rollback commands rehearsed and documented.
- CODEX + User sign-off logged.

**Deployment Steps**:

1. **Database Migrations**

   ```bash
   render run python api/run_migrations.py
   render run python -c "import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.connect('data/mosaic.db').execute('SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type=\"table\"').fetchall())"
   ```

2. **API Deployment**

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   render logs --follow
   curl https://what-is-my-delta-site-production.up.render.app/health
   ```

3. **Frontend Deployment**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy_frontend_netlify.sh
   curl -I https://whatismydelta.com/jobs/search
   ```

4. **Smoke Tests**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/verify_deploy.sh https://whatismydelta.com
   ```

   Manual validation: job search returns real data, RAG answers align, cost monitors active.

**Post-Deployment Validation**:

- All critical endpoints return 200.
- Feature flags reflect intended configuration.
- Render logs clean; analytics dashboard populates within expected timeframe.
- Cost monitors show real API usage.

**Rollback Procedure**:

```bash
git revert <deployment-commit-range>
git push origin main
./scripts/verify_deploy.sh https://whatismydelta.com
```

If rollback fails, execute previously prepared branch reset per Phase 5 instructions.

**Success Criteria**:

- Production reflects new features without 404s or major regressions.
- Validation log archived under `docs/deployments/2025-10-07_phase4.md`.
- CODEX declares release stable.

**Verification Gate**:

- CODEX + User release approval recorded after validation; if any checklist item fails, initiate rollback immediately.

**Risks & Mitigations**:

- *Risk*: Live migration failure → *Mitigation*: Take database snapshot prior to run; test migrations locally with copy.
- *Risk*: Deployment script drift → *Mitigation*: Dry run in staging (if introduced) or local container before production push.

---

## RISK MANAGEMENT & EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

**High-Risk Areas**:

1. Multi-agent miscoordination → Governed by Phase 3 protocols.
2. Production deployment without staging → Mitigated by rehearsed rollback and incremental feature releases.
3. API cost spikes → Mitigated via cost controls, usage monitors, and budget alerts.
4. Data or schema corruption → Mitigated by pre-deployment snapshots and reversible migrations.

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- Always back up (branches, DB dumps) before destructive actions.
- Execute one risky change at a time with documented outcomes.
- Maintain transparent logs for every significant step.
- Require CODEX approval at each phase gate; inability to reach CODEX triggers automatic hold.

**Emergency Protocol**:

1. **Stop** work immediately upon detecting critical failure.
2. **Stabilize** by invoking rollback procedure (code or infrastructure) within 15 minutes.
3. **Document** incident (`INCIDENT_REPORT_<timestamp>.md`) capturing cause, impact, resolution.
4. **Notify** CODEX and User; await instructions before resuming.
5. **Review** and update protocols to prevent recurrence.
