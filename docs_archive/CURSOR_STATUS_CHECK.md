## 🎯 WHAT WAS CAUSING CURSOR TO GET STUCK

1. **Complex Multi-AI Handover System**: The project had a confusing three-AI collaboration system that was causing context switching issues
2. **Uncommitted Git Changes**: Multiple modified files and untracked documentation files were causing git conflicts
3. **Over-Documentation**: Too many handover files were cluttering the workspace and confusing the AI context

## ✅ FIXES APPLIED

1. **Cleaned Git State**: Committed all changes with a single clean commit
2. **Simplified Context**: Removed complex handover protocols that were causing confusion
3. **Verified Deployments**: Both Railway and Netlify are working correctly

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

The system is working! You can now:

1. Use the website normally at `https://whatismydelta.com`
2. Continue development without the complex handover system
3. Focus on actual features instead of deployment issues

## 📁 CLEAN WORKSPACE

All the complex handover documentation has been committed but is no longer actively confusing the AI context. The project is now in a clean, working state.
