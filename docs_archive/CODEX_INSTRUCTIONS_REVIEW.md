**Assigned to**: Claude in Cursor (has full local environment access)

### **Code Analysis & Planning Access**

**Tasks requiring systematic code analysis:**

- Code review and specification writing
- Implementation planning and documentation
- Architecture analysis
- Dependency mapping
- Systematic troubleshooting documentation

**Assigned to**: CODEX (has code analysis access, limited local environment)

### **Infrastructure & Deployment Access**

**Tasks requiring infrastructure access:**

- Environment variable configuration
- Infrastructure troubleshooting
- Deployment failure analysis

**Assigned to**: Claude Code (has infrastructure debugging access)

## AI COLLABORATION ROLES

### **Claude in Cursor** - Local Implementation Engineer

- **Primary role**: Local testing, git operations, Render deployment
- **Access**: Full local environment, terminal, file system, git
- **Output format**: Terminal commands, file diffs, test results
- **Working style**: zsh-safe commands, `set -euo pipefail`, no heredocs
- **Boundaries**: Stop at Gates, await human APPROVE, minimal changes only

### **CODEX** - Systematic Planning Engineer

- **Primary role**: Code analysis, implementation planning, documentation
- **Access**: Code analysis, file reading, systematic planning
- **Output format**: Exact file diffs/content + Run Sheet (no prose)
- **Working style**: Systematic analysis, dependency mapping, architecture review
- **Boundaries**: Stop at Gates, await human APPROVE, minimal changes only

### **Claude Code** - Infrastructure Debugger

- **Primary role**: Render deployment analysis, log investigation, infrastructure debugging
- **Access**: Render logs, deployment analysis, infrastructure troubleshooting
- **Called for**: Build failures, runtime errors, missing endpoints, environment issues
- **Handoff trigger**: When deployment fails, endpoints 404, or infrastructure problems

### **Human** - Gate Keeper

- **Primary role**: Approvals, Render UI management, secret configuration
- **Responsibilities**: Verify Render project selection, manage environment variables, approve AI transitions

## HANDOFF PROTOCOLS

### **When Local Testing Required**

1. CODEX identifies need for local testing
2. CODEX hands off to Claude in Cursor with specific test requirements
3. Claude in Cursor executes tests and reports results
4. Claude in Cursor hands back to CODEX with test results

### **When Infrastructure Debugging Required**

1. Claude in Cursor identifies infrastructure issue
2. Claude in Cursor hands off to Claude Code with deployment context
3. Claude Code analyzes and provides infrastructure solution
4. Claude Code hands back to Claude in Cursor for implementation

### **When Human Approval Required**

1. Any AI identifies need for human approval (deployments, sensitive operations)
2. AI documents the request with clear rationale
3. Human approves or provides guidance
4. AI proceeds with approved action

## MOSAIC PLATFORM SCOPE

### **Complete Architecture**

- **WIMD (What Is My Delta)**: Delta analysis service (deployed)
- **Opportunity Bridge (OB)**: Job matching and application system

### **Backend Extensions (Claude in Cursor)**

- **POST /wimd**: Chat endpoint for coach interactions
- **POST /wimd/upload**: File upload handling (resumes, documents)
- **GET /ob/opportunities**: Job matching based on WIMD output
- **POST /ob/apply**: Job application submission
- **POST /resume/rewrite**: Create canonical resume from WIMD data
- **POST /resume/customize**: Customize resume for specific jobs
- **POST /resume/feedback**: Get improvement suggestions
- **GET /resume/versions**: List and manage resume versions

### **Frontend Integration (Claude in Cursor)**

- **Update mosaic_ui/index.html**: Wire real API calls
- **Add job matching interface**: Display opportunities with fit scores
- **Add resume rewrite functionality**: User-friendly resume tool
- **Add error handling**: Graceful failure management
- **Add loading states**: Clear user feedback

### **Database Schema (Claude in Cursor)**

- **SQLite with auto-expiry**: 30-day session cleanup
- **Sessions table**: User session management
- **WIMD outputs**: Analysis results and metrics
- **Job matches**: Opportunity Bridge results
- **Resume versions**: Resume iterations and feedback
- **Storage monitoring**: Usage tracking and cleanup

### **Testing Requirements (Claude in Cursor)**

- **Integration tests**: End-to-end user journey
- **Error scenario testing**: Failure handling
- **Performance testing**: Response times and storage
- **User experience testing**: Interface functionality

## PROJECT PHASES

**REVIEW REQUEST**: Please review this access-based role division and provide feedback before it replaces the original CODEX_INSTRUCTIONS.md. Key changes:

1. Access-based role assignment based on actual capabilities
2. Clear handoff protocols between AIs
3. Escalation criteria to prevent role boundary violations
4. Maintains existing workflow but with clearer assignments
