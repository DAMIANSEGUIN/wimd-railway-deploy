# Google Drive Organization Report

**Date:** 2025-10-26 17:45
**Audited by:** Scout (Claude Code)
**Authority:** Autonomous session approval

---

## Executive Summary

**Problem:** Multiple Mosaic/WIMD folders on Google Drive causing confusion for ChatGPT collaboration.

**Audit Results:**

- **4 project-related folders** found
- **2 are obsolete/empty** (MosaicPath duplicates)
- **2 are active** (WIMD-Render-Deploy-Project, Planning)
- **1 is old data** (WIMD-JSM from August)

**Recommendation:** Consolidate to single source of truth: `WIMD-Render-Deploy-Project`

---

## Detailed Audit

### 1. `gdrive:MosaicPath` (EMPTY - DELETE)

**Created:** 2025-08-26 16:10:24
**Size:** 0 bytes
**Contents:** Empty directory with only `jobsearchmaster/` subdirectory (also empty)
**Status:** ❌ OBSOLETE
**Action:** DELETE

---

### 2. `gdrive:MosaicPath` (DUPLICATE - DELETE)

**Created:** 2025-08-26 16:06:28
**Size:** 0 bytes
**Contents:** Appears to be exact duplicate of above
**Status:** ❌ DUPLICATE
**Action:** DELETE

**Note:** Google Drive shows two folders with identical names but different timestamps. This is likely from a failed upload or duplicate creation.

---

### 3. `gdrive:WIMD-JSM` (OLD DATA - ARCHIVE)

**Created:** 2025-08-26 13:03:47
**Size:** ~unknown (8 Excel files)
**Contents:**

```
data-prod/
  ├── tester_feedback.xlsx
  ├── reddit_digest.xlsx
  ├── settings.xlsx
  ├── personas.xlsx
  ├── jsm_jobs.xlsx
  ├── taxonomy_map.xlsx
  ├── wimd_output.xlsx
  └── experience.xlsx
```

**Status:** ⚠️ OLD (August 2025 - 2 months old)
**Assessment:** Job Search Master data export from August
**Relevance:** NOT related to current Mosaic UI redesign
**Action:** RENAME to `WIMD-JSM-Archive-Aug2025` (preserve for reference)

---

### 4. `gdrive:Planning` (ACTIVE - KEEP SEPARATE)

**Created:** 2025-10-16 16:46:32
**Size:** ~unknown (8 .docx files)
**Contents:**

```
├── Gestalt_Memory_Function_Optimization.docx (Oct 20)
├── Planning_Responses_Rebuild_v1.2.docx (Oct 20)
├── Career_Pathing_Prompts.docx (Oct 18)
├── Scale_Expertise_Prompt_Set_9.docx (Oct 18)
├── Memory System prompts.docx (Oct 18)
├── Strategic_Systems_Integration_Plan_v0.2.docx (Oct 18)
├── START Planning_Checklist_16.10.25.docx (Oct 18)
└── README_Plan_Archive_v1.1_full.docx (Oct 18)
```

**Status:** ✅ ACTIVE (Recent updates Oct 16-20)
**Assessment:** Your master planning system (strategic/memory/career)
**Relevance:** Separate from WIMD project - broader personal planning
**Action:** KEEP AS-IS (different system, should not merge with WIMD project)

**Referenced in Master Plan:** The UI_Redesign_Master_Plan_v1.0.md references some of these files as canonical sources for the redesign framework.

### 5. `gdrive:WIMD-Render-Deploy-Project` ✅ PRIMARY

**Created:** 2025-10-26 17:00:42
**Size:** 4.371 MB (412 files)
**Contents:** Complete current project structure

**Auto-Sync:** ✅ Enabled via git post-commit hook
**Action:** KEEP - This is the primary project ChatGPT should reference

## Consolidation Plan

### Phase 1: Delete Obsolete Folders ✅ SAFE

```
DELETE: gdrive:MosaicPath (both instances - empty)
```

### Phase 2: Archive Old Data ✅ SAFE

```
RENAME: gdrive:WIMD-JSM → gdrive:WIMD-JSM-Archive-Aug2025
```

### Phase 3: Keep Active Systems ✅ NO CHANGE

```
KEEP: gdrive:Planning (personal planning system - separate)
KEEP: gdrive:WIMD-Render-Deploy-Project (primary project - ChatGPT reference)
```

---

## Post-Cleanup Structure

**After cleanup, Google Drive will have:**

1. `WIMD-Render-Deploy-Project` ← **ChatGPT uses this**
2. `Planning` ← Your strategic planning (separate system)
3. `WIMD-JSM-Archive-Aug2025` ← Old JSM data (archived for reference)

**Eliminated:**

- ❌ MosaicPath (duplicate #1) - deleted
- ❌ MosaicPath (duplicate #2) - deleted

---

## ChatGPT Integration Instructions

**After cleanup, tell ChatGPT:**

```
Access Google Drive folder: WIMD-Render-Deploy-Project

This is the single source of truth for the Mosaic UI redesign.

Key files:
1. FOR_CHATGPT_INTEGRATION.md - Start here for full context
2. mosaic_ui/docs/redesign/UI_Redesign_Master_Plan_v1.0.md - Your implementation plan
3. mosaic_ui/index.html - Current interface
4. mosaic_ui/CLAUDE.md - Design constraints

Build implementation plan for Scout to execute.
```

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Actions ✅

- **Delete empty MosaicPath folders** - Zero data loss (0 bytes)
- **Rename WIMD-JSM** - Preserves all data, just adds archive suffix

### No Risk Actions ✅

- **Keep Planning folder** - No changes
- **Keep WIMD-Render-Deploy-Project** - Primary working directory

### Rollback Plan

If anything goes wrong:

- Empty folders: Can't be recovered (but were empty)
- WIMD-JSM rename: Simply rename back to original
- Planning/WIMD-Render-Deploy-Project: Unchanged, no rollback needed

---
