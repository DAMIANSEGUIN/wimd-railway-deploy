# Cursor & Claude Code Sync Brief (2025-10-01)

Use this note at session start. It captures changes since 2025-09-30, guardrails now in force, and actions pending human direction. Read alongside `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`, `PROTOCOL_ENFORCEMENT_PLAN.md`, and `CONVERSATION_NOTES.md`.

## 1. What Changed

- **Prompts loader failsafe**: `api/prompts_loader.py` now derives the active SHA from `data/prompts.csv` (fallback to `_clean`/`_fixed` or latest `prompts_*.json`) when `data/prompts_registry.json` is absent. Expect `/prompts/active` to succeed even if the registry is missing in deployment artifacts.
- **Structure reference**: `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` documents canonical directories, remotes, and drift checks. Treat this as the layout of record.
- **Protocol gates**: `PROTOCOL_ENFORCEMENT_PLAN.md` defines the session-start checklist, gate system (A–E), handoff triggers, and escalation rules. All agents must complete Gate A before editing.

## 2. Immediate Expectations

- Run the Session Start Checklist in `PROTOCOL_ENFORCEMENT_PLAN.md` before any edits or tests.
- Confirm `data/prompts_registry.json` is present locally prior to deploys; if missing, regenerate with `python3 - <<'PY' ... ingest_prompts("data/prompts.csv") ... PY` and document the action.
- Log every material action or observation in `CONVERSATION_NOTES.md` and update the gated items in `ROLLING_CHECKLIST.md` when applicable.

## 3. Pending Decisions (await human input)

1. **Prompts registry source control**: Should `data/prompts_registry.json` live in git (no secrets) or remain generated? Current code tolerates absence but deployments will continue to rely on runtime fallback until policy is set.
2. **Resource audit artifact**: Original CODEX dependency/layout audit has not been located in this workspace; human to mirror the document or confirm deprecation so we can reconcile with `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`.
3. **Workspace cleanup**: `.netlify/` cache artifacts and `mosaic_ui/mosaic_ui_extracted/` are outside the documented layout. Decide whether to keep, ignore, or remove.

## 4. Action Checklist by Role

- **Cursor (implementation)**
  - Validate `/prompts/active` locally and after any deployment.
  - Stage recent doc updates (`PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`, `PROTOCOL_ENFORCEMENT_PLAN.md`, `CONVERSATION_NOTES.md`) with the loader change when preparing a commit.
  - Run `scripts/predeploy_sanity.sh` before any deploy gate (Gate C) and summarize results.
- **Claude Code (infrastructure)**
  - When `/prompts/active` returns `null` on Render, verify whether the registry file is present in the deploy image; capture logs and redeploy after confirming fallback behavior.
  - Coordinate with human on the prompts registry storage decision and note outcomes in `PROTOCOL_ENFORCEMENT_PLAN.md` + `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`.
  - Keep Render deploys aligned with the Downloads workspace repo (`origin`).

## 5. Reference Stack

- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`: canonical layout, remotes, drift detection steps.
- `PROTOCOL_ENFORCEMENT_PLAN.md`: gates, handoffs, escalation.
- `AI_ROUTING_PLAN.md`: CSV → AI → metrics fallback contract for coach replies.
- `JOB_FEED_DISCOVERY_PLAN.md`: vetted-source workflow for OpportunityBridge data.
- `CONVERSATION_NOTES.md`: latest status log (see 2025-10-01 entry).
- `NETLIFY_AGENT_RUNNER_README.md`: external handoff for Netlify runners.
- `CODEX_HANDOFF_2025-10-01.md`: critical context for this cycle.

Review this brief at every handoff to avoid repeating fallbacks or bypassing the new gate system.
