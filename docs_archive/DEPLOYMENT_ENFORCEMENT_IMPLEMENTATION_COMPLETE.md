# Deployment Enforcement Implementation - Complete

**Date:** 2025-11-03
**Implemented by:** Claude_Code
**Reviewed by:** Cursor (pre-implementation sign-off)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Codex audit

---

## Implementation Summary

Automated deployment enforcement system now active. AI agents cannot push to production without passing verification checks. System prevents false positive deployments through multi-layer enforcement.

**Implementation time:** ~1.5 hours
**Files created/modified:** 12 total

## Review Locations

### 1. Implementation Plan (Original Spec)

**File:** `docs/DEPLOYMENT_AUTOMATION_ENFORCEMENT_PLAN.md`
**What to review:** Original requirements and objectives

### 2. Pre-Implementation Review (Cursor Sign-Off)

**File:** `CURSOR_REVIEW_DEPLOYMENT_ENFORCEMENT.md`
**What to review:** Cursor's conflict analysis, recommendations, and approval

### 3. Core Implementation Files

**Git Hooks:**

## What Was Implemented

### Layer 1: Git Pre-Push Hook

**Purpose:** Block production pushes that fail verification

**How it works:**

1. Detects if push target is `render-origin` (production)
2. Runs `scripts/pre_push_verification.sh`
3. Blocks push if verification fails (exit code 1)
4. Allows emergency bypass with audit logging

**Test:**

```bash
# Should be blocked by hook
git push render-origin main

# Should work (wrapper runs verification)
./scripts/push.sh render-origin main

# Emergency bypass (logged)
SKIP_VERIFICATION=true BYPASS_REASON="Production down" git push render-origin main
```

**Audit log location:** `.verification_audit.log` (gitignored)

---

### Layer 2: Verification Script

**Purpose:** Validate deployment readiness before push

**Checks performed:**

1. Pre-deployment sanity (calls existing `predeploy_sanity.sh`)
2. Critical features (calls existing `verify_critical_features.sh`)
3. Git working tree clean
4. Content validation (line count, auth, PS101)

**Exit codes:**

- `0` = All checks passed
- `1` = One or more checks failed

**Test:**

```bash
./scripts/pre_push_verification.sh
# Should show detailed check results
```

---

### Layer 3: Wrapper Scripts

**Purpose:** Replace raw commands with verified alternatives

**Scripts created:**

**`scripts/push.sh <remote> [branch]`**

- Runs verification before pushing
- Works with any remote
- Only enforces verification for `render-origin`

**`scripts/deploy.sh <netlify|render|all>`**

- Deploys with pre/post verification
- Integrates with existing `deploy_frontend_netlify.sh`
- Waits for propagation before verifying

**`scripts/verify_live_deployment.sh`**

- Checks production site content
- Validates line count, title, auth, PS101
- Exit code 1 if mismatch detected

**Test:**

```bash
# Show usage
./scripts/push.sh
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Test verification (without actual deploy)
./scripts/verify_live_deployment.sh
```

---

### Layer 4: GitHub Actions

**Purpose:** Automated deployment with verification and manual escalation

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/deploy-verification.yml`

**Steps:**

1. Pre-deployment verification (critical features)
2. Deploy to Netlify
3. Wait 60s for propagation
4. Verify live deployment
5. Flag failure for manual rollback (no automatic revert)

**Requires GitHub secrets:**

- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`
- `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`

**Test:** Push to `main` branch and watch GitHub Actions tab

---

### Layer 5: Documentation

**Purpose:** Prevent AI agents from using raw commands

**Updates made:**

1. SESSION_START_PROTOCOL.md - Added Rule 7 mandating wrapper scripts
2. COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md - Added Rule 7 forbidding raw commands
3. DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md - Updated all examples to use wrapper scripts
4. CLAUDE.md - Added deployment commands section

**Key message:** "Never use `git push` or `netlify deploy` directly - always use wrapper scripts"

---

## Testing Results

### ✅ Verified Working

1. **Pre-push hook installed and executable**
   - Location: `.githooks/pre-push`
   - Permissions: `rwxr-xr-x`
   - Bootstrap script: `./scripts/setup_hooks.sh` (sets `core.hooksPath`)

2. **Verification script detects issues**
   - Correctly identified uncommitted changes
   - Validated critical features present
   - Warned about content mismatch

3. **Wrapper scripts provide usage**
   - `push.sh` shows clear examples
   - `deploy.sh` shows targets
   - All scripts executable

4. **Documentation updated consistently**
   - 4 files updated with same message
   - Examples show wrapper script usage
   - Raw commands marked as forbidden

### ⚠️ Requires Live Testing

1. **Actual production push with wrapper**
   - Need clean git state to test
   - Will trigger GitHub Actions

2. **GitHub Actions workflow execution**
   - Requires secrets configuration
   - Needs real deployment to test verification + manual escalation path

3. **Post-deployment verification**
   - Requires live content to verify
   - Will test after next deployment

## Codex Audit Checklist

**Verify enforcement has no bypass gaps:**

- [ ] Run `./scripts/setup_hooks.sh` (or `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`) on fresh clone
- [ ] Try `git push render-origin main` directly → should be blocked by hook
- [ ] Try `./scripts/push.sh render-origin main` with failing verification → should be blocked
- [ ] Try emergency bypass → should work and log to `.verification_audit.log`
- [ ] Try `git push origin main` → should skip verification (backup repo)
- [ ] Review audit log format matches spec: `TIMESTAMP | USER | REMOTE | REASON | COMMIT_HASH`

**Verify documentation clarity:**

- [ ] Read SESSION_START_PROTOCOL.md Rule 7 - clear and unambiguous?
- [ ] Read COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md Rule 7 - forbidden commands obvious?
- [ ] Read DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md examples - all use wrapper scripts?
- [ ] Read CLAUDE.md deployment section - correct usage shown?

**Verify integration:**

- [ ] Pre-push hook doesn't break pre-commit hook
- [ ] Pre-push hook doesn't break post-commit hook (GDrive sync)
- [ ] Verification script calls existing `predeploy_sanity.sh`
- [ ] Verification script calls existing `verify_critical_features.sh`
- [ ] Deploy script calls existing `deploy_frontend_netlify.sh`

**Verify emergency scenarios:**

- [ ] SKIP_VERIFICATION bypass works and logs
- [ ] Audit log created in repo root (not .ai-agents/)
- [ ] Audit log gitignored (not committed)
- [ ] Emergency bypass requires reason (BYPASS_REASON env var)

## Known Limitations

1. **GitHub Actions not yet active**
   - Requires secrets configuration in GitHub
   - Manual rollback process still relies on human intervention

2. **Content verification uses fixed values**
   - Expected line count: 3427
   - Expected title: "Find Your Next Career Move"
   - May need update if PS101 v2 content changes

3. **Live verification requires production access**
   - Cannot fully test without deploying
   - `verify_live_deployment.sh` needs live site to check

---

## Next Steps

**For Team:**

1. **Configure GitHub Secrets** (required for GitHub Actions)

   ```
   Repository Settings → Secrets → Actions
   Add: NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN
   Add: NETLIFY_SITE_ID
   ```

2. **Test Enforcement System**

   ```bash
   # Make trivial change
   echo "# Test" >> test.md
   git add test.md
   git commit -m "Test deployment enforcement"

   # Test wrapper script
   ./scripts/push.sh render-origin main
   ```

3. **Codex Post-Implementation Audit**
   - Run audit checklist above
   - Verify no bypass gaps
   - Test emergency scenarios
   - Confirm documentation clarity

4. **Monitor First Real Deployment**
   - Watch GitHub Actions execution
   - Verify post-deployment checks pass
   - Coordinate manual rollback plan if verification fails

**For Future AI Agents:**

- **Read this file** to understand enforcement system
- **Use wrapper scripts only** - never raw commands
- **Emergency bypass** only with explicit human approval
- **Report verification failures** clearly with next steps
