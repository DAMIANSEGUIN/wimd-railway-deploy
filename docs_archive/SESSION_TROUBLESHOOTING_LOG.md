# Session Troubleshooting Log - 2025-09-30

## Issue: Domain API routing and chat "failed to fetch" error

### What Was Attempted (DO NOT RETRY THESE)

1. ❌ **Multiple empty git commits to trigger Netlify deployment** - Site wasn't connected to GitHub
2. ❌ **Copying netlify.toml to mosaic_ui directory** - Already done, wasn't the issue
3. ❌ **Adding [build] section to netlify.toml** - Made it worse
4. ❌ **Removing [build] section from netlify.toml** - Didn't fix POST proxy issue
5. ❌ **Installing Homebrew/Node.js/Netlify CLI** - Takes forever, system too old (macOS 12)
6. ❌ **Waiting for Netlify to "pick up" changes** - Site wasn't monitoring GitHub repo

### What Actually Worked

1. ✅ **Connected Netlify site to GitHub in dashboard** - This was the root cause
   - Site ID: `bb594f69-4d23-4817-b7de-dadb8b4db874` (resonant-crostata-90b706)
   - Had `Repo: N/A` - not monitoring any repository
   - User manually connected in Netlify dashboard: Settings → Build & deploy → Link repository
   - Repository: `DAMIANSEGUIN/wimd-render-deploy`
   - Base directory: `mosaic_ui`
   - Result: GET requests (health, config) now work via domain

2. ⚠️ **Netlify POST proxy limitation discovered**
   - POST requests to external URLs return `HTTP 307` redirect to `http://` (not https)
   - Browser blocks mixed content
   - This is a known Netlify limitation, not fixable via netlify.toml
   - CORS headers exist on Render but `access-control-allow-origin` missing

### Current Status

- ✅ Render backend: Fully operational at `https://what-is-my-delta-site-production.up.render.app`
- ✅ Domain GET requests: Working (`/health`, `/config`, `/prompts/active`)
- ❌ Domain POST requests: Return 307 redirect (Netlify limitation)
- ⚠️ Chat functionality: Should work via Render URL fallback in frontend (line 352 of index.html)

### Real Solution Needed

**Option 1: Fix CORS on Render backend (RECOMMENDED)**

- Add explicit `access-control-allow-origin: https://whatismydelta.com` header
- Located in: `/Users/damianseguin/WIMD-Deploy-Project/api/index.py`
- Look for CORSMiddleware configuration around line 77
- Add `allow_origins=["https://whatismydelta.com", "https://www.whatismydelta.com"]`

**Option 2: Create Netlify Function as proxy wrapper**

- Create `/Users/damianseguin/WIMD-Deploy-Project/netlify/functions/wimd.js`
- Function proxies POST requests to Render
- Frontend calls `/api/wimd` which triggers function

**Option 3: Accept that frontend calls Render directly**

- Frontend already has Render URL hardcoded as fallback (line 352)
- Just needs proper CORS headers from Render
- This is the fastest fix

### Files Modified This Session

1. `netlify.toml` (root) - Added [build] section (later removed from mosaic_ui copy)
2. `mosaic_ui/netlify.toml` - Created with redirects, added [build], then removed [build]
3. `CONVERSATION_NOTES.md` - Updated status
4. Multiple documentation files created during troubleshooting

### Key Learnings

1. **Always verify if site is connected to Git first** - Run: `curl -s "https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/sites/{SITE_ID}" | grep repo_url`
2. **Netlify POST proxying has limitations** - External URLs get 307 redirects, not true proxies
3. **Frontend fallback works** - The hardcoded Render URL in JavaScript is intentional
4. **Don't waste time on CLI installations** - Old macOS systems (12) take forever with Homebrew
5. **Read documentation before acting** - CLAUDE_CODE_README.md lines 831-843 define role clearly

### Next Action Required

~~Fix CORS headers in Render backend to explicitly allow `https://whatismydelta.com` origin, then chat will work.~~

### Update 2025-09-30 15:24

✅ **CORS fix committed** (commit 1456992) - Added explicit origins to api/index.py
⏳ **Waiting for Render auto-deploy** - Should deploy within 2-5 minutes
❌ **Current issue**: Render hasn't deployed yet, missing `access-control-allow-origin` header in response

- Browser blocks due to CORS preflight failure
- API itself works (tested with curl)
- Just needs Render to pick up the commit and redeploy

### Update 2025-09-30 15:28

❌ **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Render is NOT monitoring GitHub repository

- Last deployment: 19 hours ago
- No auto-deploy triggered from recent commits
- **Same issue as Netlify had** - service not connected to Git
- **Solution required**: Connect Render service to GitHub in Render dashboard
  - Or: Manual redeploy via Render dashboard (temporary fix)
  - Or: Install Render CLI and deploy manually

### Update 2025-09-30 15:50-16:00

❌ **Multiple CORS fix attempts FAILED**

1. ❌ **Commit 1456992**: Added explicit hardcoded origins - No `access-control-allow-origin` header
2. ❌ **Manual Render deploy**: Triggered successfully but CORS still broken
3. ❌ **Commit fcad803**: Added `expose_headers=["*"]` - Still no header
4. ❌ **Second manual deploy**: Render deployed but OPTIONS returns HTTP 400

**Critical finding**:

- curl POST works: HTTP 200 with valid response
- Browser POST fails: `net::ERR_FAILED` with CORS error
- OPTIONS preflight returns HTTP 400 (should be 200)
- Missing `access-control-allow-origin` header in OPTIONS response
- All other CORS headers present (credentials, methods, headers)

**Root issue**: FastAPI CORSMiddleware not properly handling OPTIONS preflight requests

### Update 2025-09-30 16:00

✅ **HANDED OFF TO CODEX/CURSOR**

- Created `CODEX_HANDOFF_2025-09-30.md` with complete state
- Documented all attempts and evidence
- Provided systematic approach: Test locally → Fix → Deploy → Verify
- Identified missing dependencies in build plan
- Claude Code operating outside role (making iterative commits without systematic plan)
- Codex/Cursor should own the frame going forward
