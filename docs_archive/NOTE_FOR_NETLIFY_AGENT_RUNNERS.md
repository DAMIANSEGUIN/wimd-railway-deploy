# Note for Netlify Agent Runners (NARs)

**Subject:** URGENT - Netlify deployment configuration fix needed

**Date:** 2025-11-03

---

Hi NARs,

We have a critical deployment issue that needs immediate attention. The NEW UI (with authentication) has been merged and committed locally, but Netlify is still serving the OLD UI because a configuration fix was never pushed to GitHub.

## The Problem

- Commit `c336607` exists locally with the fix to `netlify.toml`
- This commit was never pushed to `origin` (GitHub)
- Netlify is reading old config: `publish = "."` (root directory)
- Should be: `publish = "mosaic_ui"` (NEW UI location)
- Result: Netlify serves from wrong directory, user sees OLD UI

## The Fix

**Action Required:** Push commit `c336607` to origin

```bash
cd /Users/damianseguin/AI_Workspace/WIMD-Railway-Deploy-Project
git push origin main
```

After push, Netlify will auto-rebuild and serve from `mosaic_ui/index.html` (NEW UI).

## Full Details

Complete technical documentation is available in multiple locations (same file):

- **`NETLIFY_AGENT_URGENT_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md`** (root directory)
- **`frontend/NETLIFY_AGENT_URGENT_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md`**
- **`mosaic_ui/NETLIFY_AGENT_URGENT_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md`**

This document includes:

- Detailed problem analysis
- Step-by-step solution
- Verification checklist
- Quick command reference

## Verification

After push and rebuild, verify:

- Live site: <https://whatismydelta.com/>
- Title should be: "Find Your Next Career Move" (NEW UI)
- Auth modal should appear on page load
- PS101 should show "Step 1 of 10" (not 7)

## Status

- **Priority:** HIGH - User has been waiting days
- **Fix Status:** Ready locally, needs push
- **Blocking:** User cannot see NEW UI despite work being complete

Thanks for your help!
