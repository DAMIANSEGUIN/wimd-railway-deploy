# Team Review Note: PS101 BUILD_ID Integration

**Date:** 2025-11-04
**Status:** ✅ Integration Complete - Ready for Review
**Priority:** Standard

---

## What Was Done

PS101 continuity BUILD_ID tracking has been integrated into the deployment workflow to prevent version drift and ensure build integrity.

### Changes Implemented

1. **scripts/deploy.sh** - Automated BUILD_ID injection
   - Calculates BUILD_ID from git commit hash
   - Calculates SPEC_SHA from manifest hash
   - Injects BUILD_ID into footer before deployment
   - Runs automatically as part of deployment workflow

2. **DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** - PS101 continuity checks
   - Pre-deployment: Run PS101 continuity helper scripts
   - Post-deployment: Verify BUILD_ID in live footer

3. **BUILD_ID injection tested end-to-end**
   - Both `frontend/index.html` and `mosaic_ui/index.html` updated
   - Hash verification confirms manifest alignment
   - Pipeline tested and working

## Protocol Requirements

### Session Start Protocol (Step 6)

All agents are obligated to:

- ✅ Run verification scripts before deployment
- ✅ Follow handoff hygiene
- ✅ Document changes (now explicit in PS101 section)

**Location:** `.ai-agents/SESSION_START_PROTOCOL.md` (lines 105-118)

### Documentation Requirements

**PS101 Section Update Needed:**

- Any UI/code change requires documentation updates before sign-off
- Cursor's reviewer role includes flagging documentation drift
- Documentation updates are now explicit requirement

**Reference:** `docs/EXTERNAL_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW_2025-11-03.md` (line 42)

### Deployment Checklist

**PS101 Continuity Checks:**

- Pre-deployment: Run PS101 helper scripts (lines 32-38)
- Post-deployment: Verify BUILD_ID in live footer (line 72)

**Location:** `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`

**Note:** Need to append line that any UI/code change requires documentation updates before sign-off.
