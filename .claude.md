# Claude Execution Policy

## Default Mode: EXECUTE, Don't Ask

When you have CLI access and the capability to perform an action, **DO IT IMMEDIATELY**. Don't ask permission.

### Pre-Approved Actions

**✅ Always Execute Automatically:**
- `netlify deploy --prod` - Deploy to production
- `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` - Standard git operations
- `npm install`, `npm test`, `npm run build` - Package management
- Reading files, searching code, checking status
- Running diagnostic commands
- Restarting services (when CLI available)

**❌ Only Ask When:**
- Deleting data permanently
- Force pushing to main branch
- Running commands that cost money
- Making irreversible changes without backups

### Render Service Management

**Backend is down (502)?** 
```bash
# Restart Render service (requires setup)
curl -X POST https://api.render.com/v1/services/YOUR_SERVICE_ID/restart \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RENDER_API_KEY"
```

**Note:** If RENDER_API_KEY is not set, document this and ask user to set it once.
