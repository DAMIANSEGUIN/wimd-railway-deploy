# Booking System Implementation - Session Backup

**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** Backend Complete, Ready for Deployment
**Next Step:** Deploy code + Run database migrations

---

## Session Summary

### What Was Requested

User wants to implement a Google Calendar booking system for coaching sessions with:

- Free sessions (promo code WIMD25, 25 uses)
- Paid single sessions ($150 USD/CAD)
- Paid 3-session packages ($500 USD/CAD)
- Phone-only sessions (coach calls user)
- 48-hour cancellation policy with 50% penalty
- PayPal payment integration (user already has PayPal set up)

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Payment Provider:** PayPal (user has existing setup + billing agreement)
   - Alternative considered: Stripe (better UX but requires new setup)
   - Decision: Use PayPal for faster deployment

2. **Google Calendar Integration:** Service Account authentication
   - Service account email: `jobleadsmastertracker@jobleadsmastertracker.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - User shared their Google Calendar with service account
   - Calendar ID: `primary` (user's main calendar)

3. **Privacy Model:** Users only see available slots, NOT coach's calendar contents
   - Backend queries calendar via service account
   - Returns filtered list of open time slots
   - No public calendar URL needed

4. **Security:** User correctly concerned about credential exposure
   - All credentials stored in Railway environment variables (encrypted)
   - Service account has minimal permissions (calendar only)
   - No phone number shared publicly

### Google Calendar

```bash
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY='<full JSON service account key>'
COACH_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID='primary'
COACH_EMAIL='damian.seguin@gmail.com'
```

**Note:** `COACH_PHONE_NUMBER` was discussed but deliberately excluded for security reasons (user correctly identified it as unnecessary - coach calls user, not vice versa)

## Key Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema

**appointments table:**

- Stores all coaching session bookings
- Links to users, session_packages, Google Calendar events
- Tracks payment status, reschedule count, cancellation fees
- Supports backup datetime slots

**promo_codes table:**

- WIMD25 code with 25 max uses
- Tracks current usage count

**coach_availability table:**

- Default weekly schedule (day_of_week, start_time, end_time)
- Currently seeded: Mon-Fri 9AM-5PM America/Toronto

**blocked_dates table:**

- Manual date blocking for PTO/holidays
- Notify affected users option

**session_packages table:**

- 3-session packages ($500)
- Tracks sessions_used vs sessions_total
- Links to appointments via package_id

### API Flow

**Free Session Booking:**

1. User validates promo code: `GET /booking/promo/WIMD25`
2. User gets available slots: `GET /booking/availability?start_date=...&end_date=...`
3. User books session: `POST /booking/create-free` with promo code + datetime + phone
4. Backend:
   - Validates promo code has uses remaining
   - Checks slot still available
   - Creates Google Calendar event
   - Saves appointment to database
   - Decrements promo code usage
5. User receives calendar invite via email

**Paid Session Booking:**

1. User gets available slots (same as above)
2. Frontend creates PayPal order (client-side SDK)
3. User redirected to PayPal, approves payment
4. User returns to site
5. Frontend calls: `POST /booking/create-paid` with `paypal_order_id`
6. Backend:
   - Captures PayPal payment
   - If slot unavailable → refund payment
   - Creates Google Calendar event
   - Saves appointment with payment details
7. User receives calendar invite

### Mock Mode Support

Both services (`google_calendar_service.py` and `paypal_service.py`) have mock modes:

- Work without credentials for local development
- Return fake IDs (e.g., `mock_event_1234567890`)
- Log warnings indicating mock mode active
- Switch to live mode automatically when credentials detected

### Security Considerations

**User's Security Questions Addressed:**

- Credentials encrypted in Railway
- Service account has minimal permissions (calendar only)
- No public calendar access
- No coach phone number exposed
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries with `%s`)
- PayPal webhook signature verification implemented
- Authentication required for all booking endpoints

**Audit Trail:**

- All appointments logged in database
- Notification log tracks what was sent to users
- Railway deployment logs for debugging

---

## What's NOT Built Yet (Frontend)

### Still Need to Create

1. **Frontend Booking Modal** (`mosaic_ui/js/booking-modal.js`)
   - Calendar date picker UI
   - Time slot selector
   - Phone number input field
   - Promo code validation UI
   - PayPal SDK integration
   - Session type selector (Free/Paid Single/Paid Package)

2. **Modal Styles** (`mosaic_ui/css/booking-modal.css`)
   - Modal overlay design
   - Responsive mobile layout
   - PayPal button styling

3. **HTML Updates** (`mosaic_ui/index.html`)
   - "Schedule Coaching Session" button
   - Modal container HTML
   - PayPal JavaScript SDK script tag

4. **Notification Service** (`api/notification_service.py`)
   - Email confirmations (booking, cancellation, reminder)
   - SMS integration (Twilio - wire but keep disabled for 2 weeks)
   - In-app notifications

5. **Additional API Endpoints:**
   - `POST /booking/create-paid-package` - Purchase 3-session package
   - `POST /booking/use-package-session` - Book session from package
   - `PUT /booking/{id}/cancel` - Cancel appointment
   - `PUT /booking/{id}/reschedule` - Reschedule appointment
   - `POST /booking/admin/block-date` - Block dates (admin)
   - `GET /booking/admin/appointments` - View all bookings (admin)

## Next Steps (In Order)

### IMMEDIATE - Deploy Backend

1. **Commit and push booking system code:**

   ```bash
   cd /Users/damianseguin/Downloads/WIMD-Railway-Deploy-Project
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add booking system backend - PayPal + Google Calendar integration"
   git push railway-origin main
   ```

2. **Run database migrations:**

   ```bash
   # Option 1: Via Railway CLI
   railway run psql $DATABASE_URL < data/migrations/001_add_booking_tables.sql
   railway run psql $DATABASE_URL < data/migrations/002_seed_booking_data.sql

   # Option 2: Create auto-migration script (runs on startup)
   ```

3. **Verify deployment:**

   ```bash
   # Check health endpoint
   curl https://what-is-my-delta-site-production.up.railway.app/health

   # Should show:
   # - "ok": true
   # - "google_calendar": "initialized"
   # - "paypal": "initialized"
   ```

4. **Test API endpoints:**

   ```bash
   # Test promo code validation
   curl https://what-is-my-delta-site-production.up.railway.app/booking/promo/WIMD25 \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>"

   # Test availability
   curl "https://what-is-my-delta-site-production.up.railway.app/booking/availability?start_date=2025-10-28&end_date=2025-10-31" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>"
   ```

### AFTER BACKEND DEPLOYED - Build Frontend

5. Build booking modal UI
6. Integrate PayPal JavaScript SDK
7. Test end-to-end booking flow
8. Build notification service
9. Add cancellation/rescheduling UI
10. Build admin dashboard

---

## Important Context for Next Session

### User's Working Style

- User said: "treat this entire session as one prompt and only ask for my approval or input when absolutely necessary"
- User is security-conscious (correctly questioned phone number exposure)
- User prefers to use existing tools (PayPal) over setting up new ones (Stripe)
- User wants to ship fast but also wants to understand what's happening

### Blocking Issues Resolved

- ✅ Google Calendar sharing confusion (found correct section)
- ✅ Calendar ID vs. public URL confusion (clarified use `primary`)
- ✅ Service account JSON vs. Client ID string (downloaded full JSON)
- ✅ Phone number security concern (removed COACH_PHONE_NUMBER requirement)

### Current State

- ✅ All backend code written and committed locally
- ✅ All environment variables added to Railway
- ✅ Google Calendar shared with service account
- ✅ PayPal credentials configured
- ⏳ Code NOT yet pushed to Railway (waiting for user to execute git push)
- ⏳ Database migrations NOT yet run
- ❌ Frontend NOT yet built

---

## Technical Debt / Future Considerations

1. **Email Service Integration:**
   - Currently using Google Calendar's built-in email invites
   - Should add SendGrid/AWS SES for custom notification emails
   - Add templates for booking confirmation, reminders, cancellations

2. **SMS Notifications:**
   - Code ready for Twilio integration
   - User wants to wire it but keep disabled for 2 weeks
   - Set `TWILIO_SMS_ENABLED='false'` initially

3. **Cancellation Policy Enforcement:**
   - 50% fee logic implemented in `paypal_service.py`
   - Need UI for users to cancel (with fee warning)
   - Need admin override capability

4. **Package Session Booking:**
   - Database schema supports it
   - API endpoints partially implemented
   - Need to complete `POST /booking/create-paid-package` and `POST /booking/use-package-session`

5. **Admin Dashboard:**
   - Need view for all bookings
   - Need ability to block dates
   - Need ability to manually cancel/reschedule

6. **Testing:**
   - No automated tests yet
   - Need integration tests for booking flow
   - Need tests for payment capture/refund logic

7. **Monitoring:**
   - Add logging for booking events
   - Track conversion rates (promo code usage, payment success rates)
   - Monitor calendar sync issues
