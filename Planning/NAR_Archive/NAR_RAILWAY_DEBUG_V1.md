**Task Type:** Diagnose and Fix

---

## Problem

Railway deployment successful but booking routes NOT loading:

- ❌ `/booking/promo/WIMD25` returns 404 (should be 401 auth required)
- ❌ Booking routes missing from `/openapi.json` spec
- ✅ API health works: `/health`
- ✅ Other routes work: `/wimd`, `/ob`, `/resume`

**Railway Service:** <https://what-is-my-delta-site-production.up.railway.app>

```

Router registered in `api/index.py` lines 106-113:

```python
try:
    from api.booking import router as booking_router
    app.include_router(booking_router)
    logger.info("✅ Booking routes registered successfully")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"❌ Failed to register booking routes: {e}")
```

## Diagnosis Steps

4. Check for circular imports
5. Verify router registration executed

## Expected Fix
