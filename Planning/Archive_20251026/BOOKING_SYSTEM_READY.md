## What You Need to Do Before Deployment

### 1. Add Environment Variables to Railway

**Required variables** (see `BOOKING_ENV_SETUP.md` for details):

```bash
# Google Calendar
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY='<paste client_secrets.json contents>'
COACH_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID='primary'
COACH_EMAIL='your@email.com'
COACH_PHONE_NUMBER='+1234567890'

# PayPal
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID='your_client_id'
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET='your_client_secret'
PAYPAL_MODE='live'  # or 'sandbox' for testing
```

**Where to add:**

- Railway Dashboard → Your Project → Variables tab → New Variable

### 2. Share Google Calendar with Service Account

**Critical step:**

1. Go to <https://calendar.google.com> → Settings
2. Find calendar you want to use for bookings
3. "Share with specific people" → Add:

   ```
   jobleadsmastertracker@jobleadsmastertracker.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   ```

4. Permission: **"Make changes to events"**
5. Uncheck "Send email notification"
6. Click "Send"

### 3. Run Database Migrations

**Option A: Railway Console**

```bash
# SSH into Railway container
railway connect

# Run migrations
psql $DATABASE_URL < data/migrations/001_add_booking_tables.sql
psql $DATABASE_URL < data/migrations/002_seed_booking_data.sql
```

**Option B: Local then deploy**

```bash
# Run locally against Railway database
psql $(railway variables get DATABASE_URL) < data/migrations/001_add_booking_tables.sql
psql $(railway variables get DATABASE_URL) < data/migrations/002_seed_booking_data.sql
```

## How to Deploy

### Deployment Steps

```bash
# 1. Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add booking system backend - PayPal + Google Calendar integration"

# 2. Push to Railway
git push railway-origin main

# 3. Monitor deployment
railway logs --follow

# 4. Verify deployment
curl https://what-is-my-delta-site-production.up.railway.app/health
```

### Expected Log Output

After successful deployment, you should see:

```
[INFO] Google Calendar service initialized successfully
[INFO] PayPal payment service initialized successfully (live mode)
[INFO] Database migrations complete
[INFO] Booking API registered at /booking/*
```

---

## Testing the Backend

### 1. Health Check

```bash
curl https://what-is-my-delta-site-production.up.railway.app/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "services": {
    "google_calendar": "initialized",
    "paypal": "initialized"
  }
}
```

### 2. Check Availability

```bash
curl -X GET "https://what-is-my-delta-site-production.up.railway.app/booking/availability?start_date=2025-10-28&end_date=2025-10-31" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

Expected: List of available 30-min time slots

### 3. Validate Promo Code

```bash
curl https://what-is-my-delta-site-production.up.railway.app/booking/promo/WIMD25 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

Expected:

```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "uses_remaining": 25,
  "message": "Promo code valid! 25 uses remaining."
}
```

## Booking Flow (How It Works)

### Free Session Flow

1. User clicks "Schedule Coaching Session" (frontend - to be built)
2. Modal opens, user enters promo code "WIMD25"
3. Frontend calls `GET /booking/promo/WIMD25` to validate
4. User selects date/time from available slots
5. User enters phone number
6. Frontend calls `POST /booking/create-free`
7. **Backend:**
   - Validates promo code has uses left
   - Checks time slot still available
   - Creates Google Calendar event
   - Saves appointment to database
   - Decrements promo code usage
8. User receives calendar invite via email
9. Coach sees event on Google Calendar

### Paid Session Flow

1. User clicks "Schedule Coaching Session"
2. Modal opens, user selects "Single Session ($150)"
3. User selects date/time
4. User enters phone number
5. Frontend creates PayPal order (client-side SDK)
6. User redirected to PayPal to approve payment
7. User returns to site after approval
8. Frontend calls `POST /booking/create-paid` with `paypal_order_id`
9. **Backend:**
   - Captures PayPal payment
   - Checks time slot still available
   - Creates Google Calendar event
   - Saves appointment to database
10. User receives calendar invite
11. Coach sees event on Google Calendar

## Cost Analysis

### One-Time Setup: $0

### Per Transaction Costs

**PayPal Fees:**

- Domestic (USD/CAD): 2.9% + $0.30
- $150 session = $4.65 fee → $145.35 net
- $500 package = $14.80 fee → $485.20 net

**Google Calendar API:** Free (up to 1M requests/day)

**Estimated Monthly Costs** (assuming 20 sessions/month):

- PayPal fees: ~$93 (20 × $4.65)
- Google Calendar: $0
- Railway hosting: Already covered by existing plan
- **Total:** ~$93/month in transaction fees only

---

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:

```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD

# Force push to Railway
git push railway-origin main --force

# Or rollback via Railway dashboard
# Deployments tab → Previous deployment → Rollback
```

---

## Security Checklist

✅ **Environment variables encrypted** in Railway
✅ **No credentials in git** (`.env` in `.gitignore`)
✅ **PayPal webhook signature verification** implemented
✅ **SQL injection prevention** (parameterized queries with `%s`)
✅ **Authentication required** for all booking endpoints
✅ **PCI compliance** (no card data touches our server)
✅ **Service account permissions** limited to calendar access only

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Frontend)

1. ✅ Add environment variables to Railway
2. ✅ Share Google Calendar with service account
3. ✅ Run database migrations
4. ✅ Deploy to Railway
5. ✅ Test backend endpoints (see testing section above)

### After Backend is Live

6. Build frontend booking modal
7. Integrate PayPal JavaScript SDK
8. Test end-to-end booking flow
9. Build notification service (email confirmations)
10. Add admin dashboard for viewing bookings

## Questions or Issues?

**If Google Calendar events aren't created:**

- Check Railway logs for error messages
- Verify service account email has calendar access
- Confirm `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` is valid JSON

**If PayPal payments fail:**

- Check PayPal dashboard for API errors
- Verify `PAYPAL_MODE` matches your credentials
- Check `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` and `SECRET` are correct

**If availability endpoint returns empty array:**

- Run migration 002 to seed coach availability
- Check `coach_availability` table has data for Mon-Fri

**Backend Implementation: COMPLETE ✅**
**Ready for:** Environment setup + deployment + frontend development
