# Codex Playbook — Bottleneck Migration (Mosaic-bound)

## Contract
- Identify the current bottleneck gate and migrate work into deterministic, checkable artifacts.
- Produce PR-style packets, not prose.

## Prompt
Given a bottleneck, produce a migration plan that results in: (1) a single authoritative file, (2) a deterministic check, (3) a rollback step. No redesign.
