  "handoff_message": "✅ COMPLETE: Production hardening and autonomous execution protocol. USER APPROVED: 'i approve all actions in this session as 1 token'. AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION: Completed all tasks without permission-seeking as user requested. WORK COMPLETED: (1) Gate 9 - Production Connectivity Check created (.mosaic/enforcement/gate_9_production_check.py) - validates PRODUCTION REALITY not just local state. Tests: backend health, frontend loads, URLs match, no dead backends, deployment configs valid. ALL 5 CHECKS PASSING ✅. (2) Pre-push hook created (.mosaic/enforcement/pre-push) - runs Gate 9 automatically before every push. Installed to .git/hooks/pre-push. TESTED: Gate 9 ran on push to origin/main, all checks passed. (3) SESSION_INIT protocol rewritten for AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION (.mosaic/SESSION_INIT.md) - changed from 'ask permission always' to 'execute when clear, ask when stuck'. Decision tree added: path clear = execute immediately, path unclear = ask specific question. (4) CLAUDE.md Step 0 updated - embedded autonomous execution protocol (appears in system reminders for all new sessions). (5) State files updated - current_task.json and blockers.json reflect current reality. All blockers (B001-B005) marked resolved. VALIDATION: All 8 pre-commit gates passed. Gate 9 (pre-push) passed. Production verified live: Backend https://mosaic-backend-tpog.onrender.com (healthy), Frontend https://whatismydelta.com (accessible). COMMIT: 20efb0a. PUSHED: origin/main. NEXT SESSION TEST: New Claude session will test autonomous execution protocol - should execute work when path clear, only ask when stuck. PRODUCTION STATUS: Fully operational, all 9 gates enforced, Railway completely removed.",
