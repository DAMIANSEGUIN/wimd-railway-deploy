  "handoff_message": "✅ COMPLETE: Systematic Railway removal and enforcement system fixes. USER FRUSTRATION: Called out for treating symptoms instead of systemic problem ('shitty engineering'). ROOT ISSUE: Railway migration to Render completed 2026-01-05 but Railway GitHub integration NEVER disconnected → 30+ deployment failures spamming user. VALIDATION BLIND SPOT IDENTIFIED: 8-gate system validates LOCAL STATE (git, JSON, code) but NOT PRODUCTION REALITY (dead backends, broken URLs, failed deployments). SYSTEMATIC CLEANUP EXECUTED: (1) Docs: Deleted DEPLOYMENT_TRUTH.md, SETUP_AUTO_DEPLOY.md, rewrote docs/README.md for Render, updated CLAUDE.md (30+ Railway refs removed). (2) Config: Deleted railway.toml, nixpacks.toml. (3) Scripts: Updated deploy.sh (railway→render), deleted 3 Railway scripts. (4) Integration: Unlinked Railway CLI, removed railway-origin remote. (5) Verified Render production live. COMMITS: f382273, ea938cc. ENFORCEMENT FIXES: (6) Gate 6 password pattern refined (no longer catches HTML forms). (7) SESSION_INIT protocol embedded in CLAUDE.md (unavoidable in system reminders). COMMITS: 8e01aee, 83a2e6e. LESSON: Need Gate 9 - Production Connectivity Check. NEXT: User must manually disconnect Railway dashboard integration to stop spam.",
