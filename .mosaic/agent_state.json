  "handoff_message": "✅ COMPLETE: Built and tested ML-style session handoff enforcement system. Based on Nate's Eval Design + Production Monitoring prompts. Pattern shift: from behavioral programming (docs say MANDATORY) to technical enforcement (tests BLOCK until passing). Files created: handoff_validation_tests.py (--pre-handoff and --post-handoff modes), enforcement/README.md, ML_ENFORCEMENT_SUMMARY.md. Integrated into AI_AGENT_PROMPT.md Steps 2 and handoff section. Tests validate: state files exist, production state matches git, referenced files exist, git clean/documented, blockers have evidence. Demonstrated working: tests blocked me 3 times during implementation (unpushed commits, wrong commit in state, uncommitted changes), forced fixes, then passed (6/6 tests). All commits pushed to origin/main (51b33f1). Production at https://mosaic-backend-tpog.onrender.com (live). Next session: Run --post-handoff validation to test handoff worked, verify should pass. See .mosaic/SESSION_HANDOFF_2026-01-08.md for complete handoff, ML_ENFORCEMENT_SUMMARY.md for implementation details.",
