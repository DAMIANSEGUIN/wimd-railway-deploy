  "handoff_message": "Built ML-style session handoff enforcement system based on Nate's Eval Design + Production Monitoring prompts. Created .mosaic/enforcement/handoff_validation_tests.py with pre-handoff and post-handoff validation tests that BLOCK until passing (technical enforcement, not behavioral). Integrated tests into AI_AGENT_PROMPT.md Steps 2 (post-handoff validation on session start) and handoff section (pre-handoff validation before marking complete). Tests validate: state files exist, production state matches git reality, referenced files exist, git status clean/documented, blockers have evidence. Pattern: ML-style continuous validation DURING work, not post-hoc checking. Previous pattern failed because docs said 'MANDATORY' but agents ignored - this pattern BLOCKS until tests pass. Files created: handoff_validation_tests.py (executable), .mosaic/enforcement/README.md (full documentation). Next: Commit work, run pre-handoff validation to prove it works, update session_log.jsonl.",
