  "handoff_message": "✅ INDUSTRY-STANDARD GOVERNANCE IMPLEMENTED: Replaced custom AI validation with proven frameworks (SRE, DORA, Test Pyramid). SESSION WORK: (1) User identified critical architectural failure - AI agents claiming 'complete' without production validation, inventing custom validation systems instead of using industry standards. (2) ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Semantic match upgrade marked 'complete' (commit 1e57859) but production endpoints returned 404. Validation system checked local state but NOT production reality. Custom gates validated syntax/files but NOT deployed functionality. (3) SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Created industry-standard governance using ONLY proven frameworks - Google SRE (production smoke tests), DORA metrics (change failure rate), Test Pyramid (Martin Fowler). (4) NEW ARTIFACTS CREATED: PROJECT_GUARDIAN_PROMPT.md (forces AI accountability to external standards, not self-assessment), GOVERNANCE_INDUSTRY_STANDARD.md (complete rewrite using SRE/DORA/Test Pyramid), Gate 10 production smoke tests (SRE-standard endpoint validation), PRODUCTION_VALIDATION_STANDARD.md (industry best practices documentation). (5) KEY PRINCIPLE SHIFT: 'External authority only' - use proven frameworks (Google SRE, DORA Research, Martin Fowler) NOT AI-invented validation. 'Production is source of truth' - endpoints must respond before claiming complete. 'Measure don't assume' - DORA metrics track actual deployment quality. (6) VALIDATION RESULTS: Gate 10 production smoke tests: 4/4 passed ✅, Backend health: 200 OK, 188ms latency (<500ms SRE target) ✅, Frontend accessible: 200 OK ✅, Pre-handoff validation: 6/6 passed ✅, Gemini evaluation: APPROVE (90/100) ✅. (7) COMMITS THIS SESSION: cb20fe3 (governance implementation - 4 files, 1476 insertions). (8) OPEN ISSUE: Semantic match endpoints (/reranker/health, /analytics/health, /health/rag) deployment status UNKNOWN - Gate 10 didn't test them (not in recent commit message). NEXT SESSION MUST validate these endpoints before confirming semantic match upgrade actually deployed. USER REQUESTED HANDOFF for external validation sources to test. PRODUCTION STATUS: Core system operational (backend, frontend, database healthy). New governance frameworks in place. Semantic match deployment verification PENDING external testing.",
