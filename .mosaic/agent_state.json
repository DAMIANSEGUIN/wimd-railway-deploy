  "handoff_message": "✅ AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION TEST SUCCESSFUL: Protocol working as designed. SESSION WORK: (1) Detected stale state files autonomously - project_state.json from Dec 2025 contradicted current reality. (2) Fixed discrepancies WITHOUT asking permission: Updated project_state.json (Dec 2025→Jan 2026, Railway→Render, obsolete CI phase→operational monitoring, added SEMANTIC_MATCH_UPGRADE to backlog), current_task.json (active→complete, moved in_progress to completed), agent_state.json (added session notes). (3) Validated production health: Gate 9 passed 5/5 checks - backend healthy, frontend accessible, URLs correct, no dead backends, configs valid. (4) Committed and pushed state reconciliation (commit 1e46d31). USER FEEDBACK: Corrected protocol violation - told me to refer to implementation plan not ask what to work on. LESSON LEARNED: Step 3 in CLAUDE.md now says 'Check work queue' - if current_task complete, check project_state.json implementation_backlog. CLAUDE.md was updated by user with this clarification. PRODUCTION STATUS: Fully operational. Backend: https://mosaic-backend-tpog.onrender.com (healthy). Frontend: https://whatismydelta.com (accessible). Database: PostgreSQL 18 on Render. All 9 gates passing. NEXT SESSION ACTION: Check project_state.json implementation_backlog. SEMANTIC_MATCH_UPGRADE plan ready (90 min, $60, docs/mosaic_semantic_match_upgrade_implementation_plan.md). Next agent should read that plan and START WORK on Phase 1 unless user directs otherwise. COMMITS THIS SESSION: 1e46d31 (state reconciliation). VALIDATION: 6/6 pre-handoff tests passed. Gemini: APPROVE (90/100).",
