GEMINI: EMERGENCY TAKEOVER REQUEST

Claude Code has made multiple critical errors during semantic match deployment.
User requests Gemini take full control until deployment is successful.

PROJECT: /Users/damianseguin/AI_Workspace/WIMD-Deploy-Project

PROBLEM: Semantic match endpoints return 404 on Render production
- https://mosaic-backend-tpog.onrender.com/analytics/health → 404
- https://mosaic-backend-tpog.onrender.com/reranker/health → 404

ROOT CAUSE: Code in wrong directory
- Semantic match code exists in: root api/ directory
- Render deploys from: backend/api/ directory
- Code never existed in deployed location

SOLUTION: Copy semantic match files to backend/api/
1. cp api/reranker.py backend/api/
2. cp api/analytics.py backend/api/
3. Add endpoint routes to backend/api/index.py
4. Revert commit 39d39d1 (restore "rootDir: backend" in render.yaml)
5. Deploy and test

FULL CONTEXT: Read .mosaic/HANDOFF_TO_GEMINI.md for complete details

Claude is BLOCKED. Gemini has full control.

Please proceed with deployment fix.
