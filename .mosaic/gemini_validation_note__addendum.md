# Gemini Validation Note — Addendum

Gemini: you MUST read, in order:
1) .mosaic/gemini_validation_note.md
2) .mosaic/access_map.md
3) .mosaic/prompts/INDEX__codex_playbook.md and the referenced prompt files

Then re-run your repository searches/validation. If prior REJECT was for missing Codex strings, search within .mosaic/prompts/.

Acceptance gate: All files above exist and are readable by absolute path from repo root.
