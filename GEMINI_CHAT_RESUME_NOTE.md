**RAILWAY CLI ISSUE RESOLVED - DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS**

The Railway CLI ambiguity blocker has been fixed. Here's where we are:

✅ **CLI Linked:** `mosaic-backend/wimd-railway-deploy`
✅ **Deployment Started:** `railway up` executed successfully
🔄 **Current Status:** Build in progress, logs streaming

**Next Step:** Monitor build completion with `railway logs -f`

**Key Finding:** Project was `mosaic-backend` (not `wimd-career-coaching`). Duplicate project names caused the linking failure.

See full handoff document: `HANDOFF_TO_GEMINI_RAILWAY_RESOLVED.md` for complete status and next phase instructions.

**Status:** UNBLOCKED - Resume Phase 2.2 (Build Monitoring)
