# Checkpoint System - Ready for Codex Review

**To:** Codex (Product Process Analyst)
**From:** Claude Code (Troubleshooting SSE) + Damian
**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Re:** Agent checkpoint system implementation - requesting review before execution

---

## 🎯 CRITICAL CONTEXT: Two Separate Things

**You need to understand there are TWO separate workstreams:**

### Workstream 1: PS101 v2 Implementation (ALREADY DONE - HAS BUGS)

- ✅ **Status:** Code exists in `frontend/index.html` (implemented by Cursor, 3128 lines)
- ❌ **Problem:** Has 3 blocking bugs preventing deployment:
  1. Uses browser `prompt()` dialogs (accessibility issue)
  2. Validation timing wrong (can bypass validation)
  3. Step 10 incomplete (needs placeholder)
- 📄 **Documented in:** `CURSOR_FIXES_REQUIRED.md` (technical fix guide)
- ⏳ **Waiting for:** Cursor to fix bugs (will happen AFTER you review checkpoint system)

### Workstream 2: Checkpoint System (BRAND NEW - YOU'RE REVIEWING THIS)

- ✅ **Status:** Just created today (7 documents in `docs/` folder)
- 🎯 **Purpose:** Prevent agent errors, context drift, memory issues going forward
- 📋 **What it is:** Process framework with 5-checkpoint structure for all agent tasks
- 🔍 **You're reviewing:** The SYSTEM (the process), NOT the PS101 code
- ⏳ **Next step:** After you approve, Cursor will USE this system to fix PS101 bugs

### The Explicit Plan (Step-by-Step)

```
TODAY (2025-10-31):
├─ Step 1: You (Codex) review checkpoint system [THIS DOCUMENT]
├─ Step 2: You provide feedback (inline comments or executive summary)
└─ Step 3: We incorporate your feedback → System finalized

TOMORROW (2025-11-01):
├─ Step 4: Cursor uses checkpoint system → Fixes PS101 Issue #1 (browser prompts)
├─ Step 5: Cursor uses checkpoint system → Fixes PS101 Issue #2 (validation)
└─ Step 6: Cursor uses checkpoint system → Fixes PS101 Issue #3 (Step 10)

DAY AFTER (2025-11-02):
├─ Step 7: Test PS101 end-to-end using TEAM_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md
└─ Step 8: Deploy PS101 v2 if all tests pass
```

**YOU ARE REVIEWING THE TOOL (checkpoint system), NOT THE WORK (PS101 code).**

The checkpoint system is a **meta-process** for managing agents. We're testing it with PS101 fixes, but it will be used for ALL future agent tasks.

---

## 📋 Purpose of This Review

We've implemented a comprehensive checkpoint system for agent task management (Cursor, Codex, Claude Code). Before executing the first task with this system, we'd like **Codex to review** the structure and provide feedback.

**Specifically, we need Codex to assess:**

1. Is the checkpoint structure sound for project management?
2. Are there gaps in the task template?
3. Will this system scale for multiple concurrent agent tasks?
4. Any process improvements before we lock this in?

## 📄 Documents to Review

**Please review in this order:**

### 1. **`docs/AGENT_TASK_TEMPLATE.md`** ← START HERE

**What it is:** Reusable template for all agent tasks
**Key sections:**

- 5-checkpoint structure (Understanding → Approach → Implementation → Testing → Final)
- Risk tiers (1=Low, 2=Medium, 3=High)
- Context refresh protocol (every 30 min)
- Rollback plans
- Success criteria framework

**Review for:**

- [ ] Are the checkpoints sufficient to catch errors?
- [ ] Is the template too rigid or too flexible?
- [ ] Are we missing any critical sections?
- [ ] Will this work for both code tasks (Cursor) and doc tasks (Codex)?

### 2. **`docs/PS101_FIX_PROMPTS_TASK_BRIEF.md`** ← COMPLETE EXAMPLE

**What it is:** Filled-out template for PS101 v2 Issue #1 (replace browser prompts)
**Key sections:**

- Complete task context and constraints
- All 5 checkpoints with specific deliverables
- 12-step manual testing plan
- Rollback procedures

**Review for:**

- [ ] Is this clear enough for Cursor to execute autonomously?
- [ ] Are the checkpoints too granular or not granular enough?
- [ ] Are success criteria measurable?
- [ ] Is testing plan comprehensive?
- [ ] Would you (Codex) be able to execute a similar brief?

### 3. **`docs/ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md`** ← DECISION LOG

**What it is:** Record of all architectural decisions for agent reference
**Key sections:**

- 8 current decisions documented (inline forms, single-file architecture, state structure, etc.)
- Template for adding new decisions
- Monthly review schedule

**Review for:**

- [ ] Are decisions documented clearly enough?
- [ ] Is the format easy for agents to parse?
- [ ] Should we add more decisions before starting?
- [ ] Is the review schedule appropriate?

### 4. **`docs/CHECKPOINT_PLAN_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`** ← SUMMARY

**What it is:** Overview of the entire checkpoint system
**Key sections:**

- How to use the system
- Benefits for each stakeholder
- Risk mitigation matrix
- FAQ

**Review for:**

- [ ] Does this explain the system clearly?
- [ ] Are benefits compelling?
- [ ] Are we over-engineering this?
- [ ] What's missing?

## 🎯 Background Context

### Why We Built This

**Problem statement (from Damian):**
> "My concern is when errors, drift or memory issues occur with agents working on this project."

**Our solution:**

- Checkpoint-based approval gates (catch errors early)
- Written decision log (prevent drift)
- Context refresh protocol (address memory)
- Rollback plans (safety net)

### What We're Testing

**First task:** PS101 v2 Issue #1 - Replace browser `prompt()` dialogs with inline forms

- **Agent:** Cursor
- **Risk:** Tier 2 (Medium - supervised)
- **Estimated:** 1-2 hours
- **Checkpoints:** 5 (each requiring Damian's approval)

**Goal:** Validate checkpoint system works before scaling to other tasks

## 🔍 Specific Questions for Codex

### Process Questions

**1. Checkpoint Frequency**

- Current: 5 checkpoints per task (Understanding, Approach, Implementation, Testing, Final)
- Is this too many (slows progress) or too few (risks slip through)?
- Should simpler tasks use fewer checkpoints?

**2. Context Refresh Timing**

- Current: Every 30 minutes or 10 tool uses
- Is this the right frequency?
- Should it vary by agent (Cursor vs Codex vs Claude Code)?

**3. Task Brief Overhead**

- Current: Detailed brief required before each task (see PS101_FIX_PROMPTS_TASK_BRIEF.md)
- Is this sustainable for 20+ tasks per sprint?
- Should we create lightweight briefs for Tier 1 tasks?

**4. Decision Log Maintenance**

- Current: Manual updates to ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md
- Who owns keeping this updated?
- How do we ensure agents actually read it?

### Scaling Questions

**5. Multiple Concurrent Agents**

- What if Cursor works on Issue #1 while Codex works on documentation?
- Do checkpoints conflict?
- How do we sequence approvals?

**6. Documentation Tasks (Codex-specific)**

- Current system designed for code tasks
- Does this work for your documentation work?
- Do you need different checkpoints?

**7. Handoffs Between Agents**

- Example: Cursor codes, then Codex documents, then Claude Code reviews
- How do checkpoints work across agent boundaries?
- Who approves each checkpoint?

### Risk Questions

**8. What Could Go Wrong?**

- What failure modes are we not addressing?
- Where is this system fragile?
- What assumptions are we making that could break?

**9. Over-Engineering Risk**

- Are we creating more process than value?
- What's the minimum viable checkpoint system?
- Where can we simplify?

## 📊 Current Workflow (For Reference)

### Before Checkpoints (How It Was)

```
1. Damian asks agent to do task
2. Agent works autonomously for hours
3. Agent delivers result
4. Damian reviews
5. Finds issues (errors compounded, context drift, memory gaps)
6. Goes back and forth fixing issues
7. Eventually gets working result
```

**Problems:**

- Errors discovered late (expensive to fix)
- Context drift undetected until completion
- No visibility into agent's thinking
- High anxiety about what agent is doing

### With Checkpoints (How It Will Be)

```
1. Damian creates task brief using template
2. Assigns to agent with checkpoint instructions
3. Agent reads inputs, outputs understanding (Checkpoint 1)
4. Damian reviews understanding → APPROVE or CLARIFY
5. Agent plans approach (Checkpoint 2)
6. Damian reviews approach → APPROVE or REVISE
7. Agent implements (Checkpoint 3)
8. Damian reviews code → APPROVE or FIX
9. Agent tests (Checkpoint 4)
10. Damian reviews tests → APPROVE or RETEST
11. Agent confirms complete (Checkpoint 5)
12. Damian final review → COMMIT or REJECT
```

**Benefits:**

- Errors caught at each stage (cheap to fix)
- Context verified every 30 min + at checkpoints
- Full visibility into agent's process
- Damian approves at key milestones
