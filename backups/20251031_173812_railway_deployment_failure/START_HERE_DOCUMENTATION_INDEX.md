# 📚 Documentation Index - START HERE

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-31
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for all project documentation
**For:** Team members who need to know what documents exist and which to read

## 🎯 CURRENT STATE (What's Happening Right Now)

**Two separate workstreams in parallel:**

### 1. PS101 v2 → Code exists, has bugs, waiting for fixes

- ✅ **Implemented:** Cursor already coded PS101 v2 (10 steps, 42 prompts, experiments)
- ❌ **Blocked:** 3 bugs prevent deployment (browser prompts, validation, Step 10)
- 📄 **Next:** Cursor will fix bugs using checkpoint system (tomorrow)
- 📍 **Status:** PAUSED until checkpoint system approved

### 2. Checkpoint System → Just created, needs Codex review

- ✅ **Created:** 7 documents defining process for managing agents
- 🔍 **Now:** Codex reviewing system (today)
- 📄 **Next:** Use system to fix PS101 bugs (tomorrow)
- 📍 **Status:** IN REVIEW (blocking PS101 fixes)

**The Plan:**

```
TODAY: Codex reviews checkpoint system → We incorporate feedback
TOMORROW: Cursor fixes PS101 bugs using approved checkpoint system
DAY AFTER: Test & deploy PS101 v2
```

## 📞 Who to Ask

**Questions about:**

- **PS101 v2 fixes** → Read `CURSOR_FIXES_REQUIRED.md` first, then ask Damian

- **Architecture decisions** → Read `ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md` (answers likely there)
- **Project status** → Read `PROJECT_PLAN_ADJUSTMENTS.md`
- **Which doc to read** → This file (you're here)

---

## 🔄 Maintenance

**This index should be updated:**

- When new documents created
- When documents become obsolete
- When document status changes (current → reference → obsolete)
