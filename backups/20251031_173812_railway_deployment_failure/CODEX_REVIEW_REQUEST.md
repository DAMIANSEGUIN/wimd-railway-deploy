# Codex Review Request - Checkpoint System

**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Requested by:** Damian + Claude Code
**Urgency:** Need feedback by EOD to proceed with PS101 v2 fixes tomorrow

---

## What We Need You to Review

**NEW: Agent Checkpoint System** (process framework for managing Cursor/Codex/Claude Code)

We've created a 5-checkpoint workflow to prevent agent errors, context drift, and memory issues. Before using it to fix PS101 v2 bugs, we need your review to ensure it's sound.

## Documents to Review (in order)

1. **`docs/AGENT_TASK_TEMPLATE.md`** - Template structure with 5 checkpoints
2. **`docs/PS101_FIX_PROMPTS_TASK_BRIEF.md`** - Complete example (Issue #1 fix)
3. **`docs/ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md`** - Decision log format (8 decisions)
4. **`docs/CHECKPOINT_PLAN_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`** - System overview

**Quick orientation:** `docs/START_HERE_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`

## PS101 v2 Issues (All Documented)

**Status:** Code exists in `frontend/index.html` (3128 lines) but has 3 blocking bugs

### Issue #1: Browser Prompts (P0 - Blocker)

- **Problem:** Uses `prompt()` and `confirm()` dialogs (lines 3014-3051)
- **Impact:** Blocks UI, not accessible, poor UX
- **Fix:** Replace with inline forms (1-2h)
- **Documented in:** CURSOR_FIXES_REQUIRED.md lines 34-202
- **Task brief ready:** PS101_FIX_PROMPTS_TASK_BRIEF.md

### Issue #2: Validation Timing (P1 - Data Integrity)

- **Problem:** Can bypass experiment validation by navigating backward (lines 2320-2370)
- **Impact:** Incomplete experiments saved
- **Fix:** Always validate on last prompt of Steps 6-9 (1h)
- **Documented in:** CURSOR_FIXES_REQUIRED.md lines 204-263

### Issue #3: Step 10 Placeholder (P1 - User Expectation)

- **Problem:** Mastery Dashboard not implemented (line 2700)
- **Impact:** Users expect dashboard but get nothing
- **Fix:** Add placeholder with "Coming Soon" (30 min)
- **Documented in:** CURSOR_FIXES_REQUIRED.md lines 265-318

**Total blocking work:** 2.5-4 hours (all fixes documented with code snippets)

## What We Need from You

1. **Process Review:** Is 5-checkpoint structure sound?
2. **Template Feedback:** Gaps or improvements in AGENT_TASK_TEMPLATE.md?
3. **Scaling Assessment:** Will this work for multiple concurrent agents?
4. **Ready-to-Execute:** Is PS101_FIX_PROMPTS_TASK_BRIEF.md clear for Cursor?
5. **Documentation Adaptation:** How would you use this for doc tasks?

---

## Timeline
