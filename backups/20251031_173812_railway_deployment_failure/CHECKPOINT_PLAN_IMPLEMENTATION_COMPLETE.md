# ✅ Checkpoint Plan Implementation - Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Status:** Ready for execution
**By:** Claude Code (Troubleshooting SSE)

---

## What Was Implemented

Following your directive "implement the checkpoint plan," I've created a complete agent checkpoint system with:

### 1. ✅ Architectural Decisions Log

**File:** `docs/ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md`

- 8 current decisions documented (PS101 v2 architecture)
- Template for adding new decisions
- Monthly review schedule

### 2. ✅ Agent Task Template

**File:** `docs/AGENT_TASK_TEMPLATE.md`

- Reusable template for all agent tasks
- 5-checkpoint structure (Understanding → Approach → Implementation → Testing → Final)
- Risk tiers (1=Low, 2=Medium, 3=High)
- Context refresh protocol
- Rollback plans
- Success criteria framework

### 3. ✅ PS101 v2 Specific Task Brief

**File:** `docs/PS101_FIX_PROMPTS_TASK_BRIEF.md`

- Complete task brief for Issue #1 (replace browser prompts)
- All 5 checkpoints filled out with specific requirements
- Manual testing plan (12 test scenarios)
- Detailed success criteria
- Ready for Cursor to execute

### 4. ✅ Codex Amendments Applied

**Files Updated:**

- `docs/PROJECT_PLAN_ADJUSTMENTS.md`
- `docs/SHARE_PROJECT_PLAN_ADJUSTMENTS.md`

**Corrections made:**

- Fixed non-existent test references (test_golden_dataset.py → test_ps101_personas.py)
- Fixed non-existent script references (validate_data_quality.py → marked as TODO)
- Corrected OPERATIONS_MANUAL approach (expand existing, not duplicate)
- Marked rotate_api_key.sh as TODO (net-new work)

## How to Use the Checkpoint System

### For PS101 v2 Fixes (Immediate Use)

**1. Assign Task to Cursor:**

```
Cursor, please read and execute:
- docs/PS101_FIX_PROMPTS_TASK_BRIEF.md

Start at Checkpoint 1. After completing each checkpoint, pause and wait for my approval before proceeding.
```

**2. Cursor Executes Checkpoint 1:**
Cursor reads inputs and outputs understanding verification (see task brief lines 165-179)

**3. You Review & Approve:**

- Read Cursor's understanding
- Verify correct interpretation
- Approve: "Proceed to Checkpoint 2" OR clarify misunderstandings

**4. Repeat for Checkpoints 2-5:**
Each checkpoint has specific deliverables and approval gates

**5. After Final Checkpoint:**

- You execute git commit
- Monitor for 5-10 minutes
- Mark task complete

### For Future Tasks

**1. Copy template:**

```bash
cp docs/AGENT_TASK_TEMPLATE.md docs/[NEW_TASK_ID]_TASK_BRIEF.md
```

**2. Fill out all sections:**

- Context (what/why)
- Inputs (docs to read)
- Constraints (do NOT / MUST)
- Success criteria
- 5 checkpoints
- Testing plan
- Rollback plan

**3. Assign to agent with checkpoint instructions**

**4. Monitor checkpoint execution**

## Checkpoint Structure (All Tasks)

### Checkpoint 1: Understanding Verification

**Purpose:** Catch misunderstandings before any work starts
**Agent outputs:** Problem summary, files to modify, questions
**You review:** Understanding correct?
**Prevents:** Working on wrong thing, wasting time

### Checkpoint 2: Approach Approval

**Purpose:** Catch bad approaches before implementation
**Agent outputs:** Implementation plan, risks, time estimate
**You review:** Approach sound? Follows decisions?
**Prevents:** Wrong architecture, later rework

### Checkpoint 3: Implementation Review

**Purpose:** Catch code issues before testing
**Agent outputs:** All code changes, explanations
**You review:** Code correct? No side effects?
**Prevents:** Bugs, breaking changes

### Checkpoint 4: Testing Verification

**Purpose:** Catch issues before commit
**Agent outputs:** Test results, pass/fail status
**You review:** All tests passed? Manually verify?
**Prevents:** Deploying broken code

### Checkpoint 5: Final Approval

**Purpose:** Final gate before commit
**Agent outputs:** Confirmation all criteria met, commit message
**You review:** Everything looks good?
**Prevents:** Incomplete work being committed

## Benefits of This System

### For You (Damian)

✅ **Control:** Approve at each major milestone
✅ **Visibility:** See agent's thinking at each step
✅ **Safety:** Catch errors early (not after 4 hours of work)
✅ **Learning:** Understand how agent approaches problems
✅ **Efficiency:** Agents do heavy lifting, you provide judgment

### For Agents (Cursor/Codex/Claude Code)

✅ **Clarity:** Know exactly what's expected
✅ **Structure:** Clear workflow to follow
✅ **Feedback:** Get corrections early
✅ **Autonomy:** Work independently between checkpoints
✅ **Context:** Decision log prevents drift

### For Project

✅ **Quality:** Fewer bugs slip through
✅ **Consistency:** All agents follow same patterns
✅ **Documentation:** Decisions recorded for future
✅ **Speed:** Less rework from catching issues early
✅ **Safety:** Rollback plans for everything

## Risk Mitigation Matrix

| Your Concern | How Checkpoints Address It |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Error compounding** | Checkpoint 3 reviews code before testing, catches errors early |
| **Context drift** | Context refresh protocol every 30 min, decision log re-read |
| **Memory issues** | Written decision log, agent must re-read on each session start |
| **Inconsistent patterns** | Checkpoint 2 verifies approach follows architectural decisions |
| **Breaking working code** | Checkpoint 4 requires regression testing, rollback plan ready |

## Multi-Agent Sequencing & Handoffs

### When Agents Work in Parallel

**Scenario:** Cursor (code), Codex (docs), Claude Code (infra) working simultaneously

**Coordination Rules:**

1. **Independent work:** Agents work on separate files/components → No coordination needed
2. **Sequential dependencies:** Task A must complete before Task B → Use checkpoint handoffs
3. **Shared resources:** Multiple agents modify same file → Sequential only, not parallel

### Checkpoint Handoffs Between Agents

**Pattern:** Cursor codes → Codex documents → Claude Code reviews

**Flow:**

```
1. Cursor completes Checkpoints 1-5 for code implementation
   → Human approves Checkpoint 5
   → Code committed to git

2. Human creates new task brief for Codex:
   - Input: Cursor's committed code
   - Task: Update documentation with new feature
   - Checkpoints 1-3 (lite mode for docs)

3. Codex completes documentation checkpoints
   → Human approves Checkpoint 3
   → Docs committed to git

4. Human creates task brief for Claude Code (if needed):
   - Input: Cursor's code + Codex's docs
   - Task: Update infrastructure/deploy configs
   - Checkpoints as appropriate
```

### Approval Responsibility by Agent Type

| Agent Type | Who Approves Checkpoints | Notes |
|------------|-------------------------|-------|
| **Cursor** (code) | Damian or Claude Code | Technical review required |
| **Codex** (docs) | Damian or designated reviewer | Content/clarity review |
| **Claude Code** (infra) | Damian only | Infrastructure changes need owner approval |

### Parallel Agent Example

**Task:** PS101 v2 fixes (3 issues) + documentation update

**Parallel approach (NOT RECOMMENDED for PS101 - too interdependent):**

- Cursor: Issue #1 (browser prompts)
- Codex: Update OPERATIONS_MANUAL in parallel
- Result: Conflict - Codex may document old behavior

**Sequential approach (RECOMMENDED):**

```
Day 1 AM: Cursor fixes Issue #1 → Checkpoints 1-5 → Commit
Day 1 PM: Cursor fixes Issue #2 → Checkpoints 1-5 → Commit
Day 2 AM: Cursor fixes Issue #3 → Checkpoints 1-5 → Commit
Day 2 PM: Codex documents all 3 fixes → Checkpoints 1-3 → Commit
```

### Avoiding Checkpoint Collisions

**Problem:** Damian reviewing Cursor's Checkpoint 3 while Codex needs Checkpoint 2 approval

**Solution: Staggered timing**

- Cursor works 9-11am → checkpoints at 10am, 11am
- Codex works 2-4pm → checkpoints at 3pm, 4pm
- OR: Queue system (Cursor's checkpoints have priority, Codex waits)

**If urgent parallel work needed:**

- Use separate communication channels (Cursor in Slack, Codex in email)
- Tag checkpoints with agent name: "[Cursor C3]" vs "[Codex C2]"

## Decision Points for You

### Decision 1: When to Start?

- **Option A:** Start now (assign task to Cursor immediately)
- **Option B:** Review system first, start tomorrow
- **Option C:** Make small adjustments to task brief first

**My recommendation:** Option A if you have 2-4 hours available today, Option B otherwise

### Decision 2: Who Reviews Checkpoints?

- **Option A:** You review all 5 checkpoints (maximum control)
- **Option B:** You review 1,2,5; auto-approve 3,4 if no errors (faster)
- **Option C:** You review 1,2; I (Claude Code) review 3,4,5 and report to you

**My recommendation:** Option A for first task (validate system), Option B for subsequent tasks

### Decision 3: How Strict on Checkpoints?

- **Option A:** Strict - No deviation from plan allowed
- **Option B:** Flexible - Small deviations OK if agent explains
- **Option C:** Trust-but-verify - Agent has autonomy, you spot-check

**My recommendation:** Option B (balance of control and efficiency)

## FAQ

### Q: What if agent fails a checkpoint?

**A:** Provide specific feedback, agent revises, re-submit for that checkpoint. Don't proceed until checkpoint passes.

### Q: What if task takes longer than estimated?

**A:** Agent must stop at 30-min marks for context refresh. If consistently over-estimate, adjust future estimates.

### Q: Can I skip checkpoints for simple tasks?

**A:** Yes - Tier 1 tasks (docs, read-only) can use simplified 2-checkpoint model (Understanding + Final). Use judgment.

### Q: What if I disagree with agent's approach at Checkpoint 2?

**A:** Explain your alternative approach, agent revises plan, re-submit Checkpoint 2. Better to catch at planning than after implementation.

### Q: Do all 3 agents (Cursor/Codex/Claude Code) use same system?

**A:** Yes - same template, same checkpoints. Tier level may differ (Codex docs = Tier 1, Cursor code = Tier 2).

## Success Criteria for Checkpoint System

**System is working if:**

- ✅ Agents catch misunderstandings at Checkpoint 1 (not after implementation)
- ✅ You feel in control of agent work (not anxious)
- ✅ Major issues caught at checkpoints (not in production)
- ✅ Task completion time predictable (estimates improve)
- ✅ Code quality consistent (following decisions)

**System needs adjustment if:**

- ❌ Too many back-and-forth revisions (checkpoints too strict?)
- ❌ Issues still slipping through (checkpoints not thorough enough?)
- ❌ Agents confused by task briefs (template needs clarity?)
- ❌ You spending more time reviewing than agents spend working (too much overhead?)
