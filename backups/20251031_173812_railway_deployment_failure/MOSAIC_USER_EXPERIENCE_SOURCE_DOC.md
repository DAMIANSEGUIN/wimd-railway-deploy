## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Based on comprehensive documentation analysis, the Mosaic platform is designed as a **career problem-solving system** that guides users through a structured approach to career transition using David Epstein's concepts. The system combines:

1. **WIMD (What Is My Delta)** - Frontend experience for self-discovery and problem-solving
2. **Opportunity Bridge (OB)** - Backend system for job matching and career opportunities
3. **Small Experiments Framework** - Critical missing component for testing career hypotheses
4. **Coaching Intelligence** - AI coach that reads users and directs them to appropriate tools

## CRITICAL ANALYSIS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### **STRENGTHS OF CURRENT APPROACH**

1. **Solid Technical Foundation**: Authentication, API endpoints, and database are well-implemented
2. **Clean User Interface**: Minimal, focused design that doesn't overwhelm users
3. **Comprehensive Architecture**: Backend and frontend are properly separated and integrated
4. **User Experience Focus**: Auto-save, progress tracking, and session management are well-thought-out

### **AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT**

1. **Missing Problem-Solving Framework**: The core methodology for career problem-solving is not clearly implemented
2. **Lack of Experimentation Tools**: Users need ways to test their career hypotheses
3. **Insufficient Coaching Intelligence**: The AI coach needs to be more proactive in guiding users
4. **Unclear Delta Concept**: The explore-exploit dyad and delta concept need better expression

### **RECOMMENDED ENHANCEMENTS**

1. **Implement Small Experiments Framework**: This is the most critical missing piece
2. **Enhance Coaching Intelligence**: Make the AI coach more proactive and intelligent
3. **Clarify Experience Flow**: Better communicate the WIMD/OB distinction
4. **Add Delta Visualization**: Help users understand their current vs. desired state

## CONCLUSION

The Mosaic platform has a solid technical foundation but is missing the core problem-solving methodology and experimentation framework that makes it truly valuable for career transition. The implementation plan focuses on adding these critical missing pieces while enhancing the existing coaching and user experience systems.

The key insight is that Mosaic should be a **career problem-solving laboratory** where users can test hypotheses, gather evidence, and make informed decisions about their career path. This requires not just technical implementation but a fundamental shift in how users interact with the system.
