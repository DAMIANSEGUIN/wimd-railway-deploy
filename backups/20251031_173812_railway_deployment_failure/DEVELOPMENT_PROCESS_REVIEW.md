# PS101 v2 Development Process Review

**Review Date:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
**Project:** WIMD-Render-Deploy-Project
**Feature:** PS101 v2 + Small Experiments Framework

---

## Process Overview

### Development Approach

This implementation followed an **agent-driven, iterative development** process using Cursor's AI capabilities to manage a large-scale refactor (estimated 40-48 engineer hours).

### Key Decisions

1. **Agent-Driven Implementation**
   - Used Cursor's agentic capabilities for systematic refactoring
   - Broke large task into phases documented in `docs/CURSOR_AGENT_PROMPT_PS101_V2.md`
   - Benefits: Consistency, reduced human error, comprehensive coverage

2. **Single-File Architecture Maintained**
   - All code remains in `frontend/index.html`
   - No build tools or frameworks introduced
   - Maintains existing vanilla JavaScript constraint

3. **Incremental State Migration**
   - v1 to v2 state migration with backward compatibility
   - Gradual rollout possible with dual-state support

4. **Small Experiments as Day 1 Deliverable**
   - Integrated directly into Steps 6-9 (not deferred)
   - Full experiment data model from start
   - Sets foundation for future experiment tracking

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (✅ Complete)

- **Goal:** Replace 7-step with 10-step structure
- **Actions:**
  - Extracted canonical steps from `api/ps101_flow.py`
  - Rebuilt `PS101_STEPS` array with all prompts
  - Updated HTML progress indicators (10 dots)
- **Duration:** ~2 hours
- **Outcome:** Solid foundation for multi-prompt system

### Phase 2: Multi-Prompt System (✅ Complete)

- **Goal:** Implement prompt-by-prompt navigation
- **Actions:**
  - Extended `PS101State` with `currentPromptIndex`
  - Updated state structure to `steps[stepNum].prompts[]`
  - Modified `renderCurrentStep()` for prompt display
  - Added prompt progress indicators
- **Duration:** ~3 hours
- **Outcome:** Smooth prompt-by-prompt user experience

### Phase 3: Experiment Framework (✅ Complete)

- **Goal:** Build Small Experiments components (Steps 6-9)
- **Actions:**
  - Added experiment management methods to state
  - Created HTML structure for experiment components
  - Built CSS styling with Peripheral Calm aesthetic
  - Implemented rendering functions for each component
  - Added event listeners and auto-save
  - Integrated validation for experiment fields
- **Duration:** ~8 hours
- **Outcome:** Fully functional experiment tracking system

### Phase 4: Integration & Validation (✅ Complete)

- **Goal:** Ensure all pieces work together
- **Actions:**
  - Updated validation rules for multi-prompt + experiments
  - Fixed navigation button states
  - Verified state persistence
  - Tested migration path
- **Duration:** ~2 hours
- **Outcome:** Cohesive, validated system

## Strengths of This Process

### 1. Systematic Approach

- Clear phase breakdown
- Each phase had specific deliverables
- Progress tracked with TODO list

### 2. Spec-Driven Development

- Primary reference: `docs/PS101_CANONICAL_SPEC_V2.md`
- Canonical source: `api/ps101_flow.py`
- Reduced ambiguity and rework

### 3. Incremental Validation

- Linter checks throughout
- Validation rules implemented early
- State structure validated at each step

### 4. Documentation

- Implementation summary created
- Process review documented
- Backup strategy in place

## Challenges Encountered

### 1. Encoding Issues

- **Issue:** Non-ASCII characters appearing in code during copy-paste operations
- **Solution:** Manual cleanup using `search_replace` with exact matches
- **Prevention:** More careful string handling, validation

### 2. Large File Edits

- **Issue:** `frontend/index.html` is 3000+ lines, making edits error-prone
- **Solution:** Used precise line references and `grep` to locate exact code
- **Prevention:** Consider file splitting for future large features

### 3. State Migration Complexity

- **Issue:** Migrating from flat `answers` object to nested `steps` structure
- **Solution:** Automatic migration function that converts old format
- **Prevention:** Clear migration path documented

### 4. Experiment Component Integration

- **Issue:** Showing/hiding components based on step and prompt index
- **Solution:** Conditional rendering in `renderCurrentStep()` with clear logic
- **Prevention:** Component visibility state management could be cleaner

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ✅

1. **Agent-driven refactoring** - Efficient for large-scale changes
2. **Spec-first approach** - Clear requirements prevented scope creep
3. **Incremental commits** - Easier to track changes (though not committed yet)
4. **Backup strategy** - Protected work throughout process

### What Could Be Improved 🔄

1. **Testing earlier** - More manual testing during development
2. **Code splitting** - Consider modular approach for very large files
3. **Type safety** - Could benefit from TypeScript or JSDoc types
4. **Component architecture** - Experiment components could be more reusable

---

## Team Review Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Code Review**
   - Review state management approach (`PS101State` object)
   - Evaluate experiment component structure
   - Check for potential performance issues

2. **Functional Testing**
   - Complete end-to-end flow testing
   - Test edge cases (empty states, long text, etc.)
   - Verify all validation rules

3. **User Experience Review**
   - Test multi-prompt flow usability
   - Evaluate experiment component interactions
   - Check mobile responsiveness

4. **Backup Verification**
   - Confirm backup files are complete
   - Test restore process
   - Document backup restoration steps

### Strategic Decisions Needed

1. **Step 10 Implementation**
   - Design Mastery Dashboard
   - Determine aggregation requirements
   - Plan completion screen updates

2. **Backend Integration**
   - Design API contract for experiments
   - Plan sync strategy
   - Consider conflict resolution

3. **Enhancement Prioritization**
   - Delta visualization
   - Explore/Exploit tagging
   - Coaching nudges
   - Resource suggestions

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅

- State migration (tested, automatic)
- Multi-prompt navigation (straightforward logic)
- Experiment data structure (well-defined)

### Medium Risk ⚠️

- Large file size (3000+ lines) - harder to maintain
- No automated tests - manual testing required
- Backend sync not yet implemented - data only in localStorage

### High Risk 🔴

- None identified at this time
