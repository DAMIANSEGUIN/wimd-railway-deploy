## Your Tasks (Browser)

### Task 1: Implement Draggable/Resizable Windows

**Read full spec**: `mosaic_draggable_windows_spec.md`

**Quick version**:

1. Create `src/components/DraggableWindow.jsx` (code in spec)
2. Wrap PS101 coaching steps (or other key UI) in `<DraggableWindow>`
3. Add z-index management (clicked window comes to front)
4. Add mobile detection (disable dragging on <768px screens)
5. Test locally
6. Deploy to Netlify

**Packages already installed**:

- `react-draggable`
- `re-resizable`

**Example usage** (from spec):

```jsx
<DraggableWindow
  title="What Is My Delta?"
  defaultWidth={500}
  defaultHeight={400}
  defaultPosition={{ x: 50, y: 50 }}
>
  <textarea placeholder="Describe your situation..." />
</DraggableWindow>
```

---

### Task 2: Add Google Calendar Booking

**Read full spec**: `mosaic_appointment_booking_spec.md`

**Quick version**:

1. Add booking button/link to PS101 results page (or user dashboard)
2. Use this URL: `https://calendar.app.google/EAnDSz2CcTtH849x6`
3. Choose implementation:
   - **Simple link** (fastest): Opens in new tab
   - **Embedded iframe** (better UX): Stays on site
4. Test locally
5. Deploy to Netlify

**Recommended Phase 1**: Simple link (2 minutes)
**Phase 2**: Embedded iframe (if desired)

**Example code** (from spec):

```jsx
<a
  href="https://calendar.app.google/EAnDSz2CcTtH849x6"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
  className="book-session-button"
>
  Book a Coaching Session
</a>
```
