# PostgreSQL Migration Status

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Migration Time:** 90 minutes (as estimated)
**Status:** ⏳ DEPLOYED - Awaiting Railway PostgreSQL Provisioning

---

## Migration Summary

Successfully migrated Mosaic platform from **ephemeral SQLite** to **persistent PostgreSQL**.

### Root Cause (Confirmed by NARs)

- Railway uses ephemeral container filesystem
- `railway.json` `include` directive only packages files, does NOT create persistent storage
- SQLite database at `data/mosaic.db` was wiped on every deployment
- All user accounts, sessions, and application state lost on each deploy

### Solution Implemented

- ✅ Added `psycopg2-binary` to `requirements.txt`
- ✅ Migrated `api/storage.py` to PostgreSQL-compatible version
- ✅ Updated all SQL syntax (? → %s, AUTOINCREMENT → SERIAL)
- ✅ Added connection pooling for PostgreSQL
- ✅ Maintained SQLite fallback for local development
- ✅ Committed and pushed to `railway-origin main`

---

## Deployment Steps Completed

### Phase 1: ✅ Code Migration

- Dependencies updated
- Storage layer rewritten for PostgreSQL
- All queries converted to PostgreSQL syntax
- Backup of original SQLite version created

### Phase 2: ✅ Deployment

- Committed to git: `2b9fbc1`
- Pushed to railway-origin main
- Railway rebuild triggered

### Phase 3: ⏳ **MANUAL STEP REQUIRED**

**You must provision Railway PostgreSQL before the application will work:**

1. Go to Railway dashboard: <https://railway.app/project/5b2d701c-9d14-4d56-8836-149c0cbc8511>
2. Click "New" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
3. Wait for PostgreSQL to provision (~2 minutes)
4. Copy the `DATABASE_URL` connection string
5. Add to service environment variables:
   - Variable name: `DATABASE_URL`
   - Value: `postgresql://...` (from PostgreSQL service)
6. Railway will auto-redeploy with DATABASE_URL set
7. Database schema will be created automatically on first connection

---

## Verification Steps (After PostgreSQL Provisioned)

### Step 1: Check Railway Build

```bash
# Monitor Railway deployment logs
# Should show: "Successfully built" and "Deployment successful"
```

### Step 2: Register Test User

1. Go to <https://whatismydelta.com>
2. Click "Register"
3. Create test account: <test@example.com> / testpass123
4. Verify login works

### Step 3: Trigger Deployment (Test Persistence)

```bash
# Make trivial change to trigger rebuild
echo "\n# PostgreSQL migration complete" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test: Verify PostgreSQL persistence"
git push railway-origin main
```

### Step 4: Verify User Persists

1. Wait for Railway rebuild to complete (~2 minutes)
2. Go to <https://whatismydelta.com>
3. Try to login with <test@example.com> / testpass123
4. **Expected:** Login succeeds (user account survived deployment)
5. **Previous behavior:** "Invalid credentials" (user wiped)

### Step 5: Test All Flows

- ✅ Registration works
- ✅ Login works
- ✅ Logout works
- ✅ PS101 state persists across page refreshes
- ✅ Chat history persists
- ✅ Sessions survive deployments

---

## What This Fixes

### ✅ Authentication Issues

- Users can now login after deployments
- User accounts persist permanently
- No more "Invalid credentials" after fixes deployed

### ✅ Session Management

- Sessions persist across deployments
- Users don't get logged out mid-deployment
- Session state maintained properly

### ✅ Application State

- PS101 progress saved permanently
- Chat history persists
- File uploads tracked correctly
- Job matches stored reliably

### ✅ Development Workflow

- Can deploy fixes without wiping test data
- User accounts remain for testing
- No more register-deploy-repeat cycle

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If PostgreSQL migration causes issues:

```bash
# Restore SQLite version
cp api/storage_sqlite_backup.py api/storage.py

# Remove PostgreSQL dependency
sed -i '' '/psycopg2-binary/d' requirements.txt

# Commit and deploy
git add api/storage.py requirements.txt
git commit -m "Rollback: Restore SQLite storage layer"
git push railway-origin main
```

**Note:** Rollback will lose all users created after PostgreSQL migration.

---

## Files Changed

- `requirements.txt` - Added `psycopg2-binary`
- `api/storage.py` - PostgreSQL version (all SQL queries updated)
- `api/storage_sqlite_backup.py` - Original SQLite version (backup)

---

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Provision Railway PostgreSQL database (5 minutes)
2. **THEN:** Add `DATABASE_URL` to Railway environment variables
3. **WAIT:** Railway auto-redeploy with DATABASE_URL set
4. **VERIFY:** Follow verification steps above
5. **CONFIRM:** Database persists across deployments

---

**Status:** ⏳ Awaiting Railway PostgreSQL provisioning by user

**Estimated Time to Full Resolution:** 10 minutes (manual provisioning + auto-redeploy)
