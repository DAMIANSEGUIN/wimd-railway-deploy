2. **Google Calendar Appointment Booking** - Add booking link for coaching sessions

## File Locations (In This Directory)

All files are located in the `mosaic_ui/` directory where you are currently working:

  - `docs/specs/mosaic_appointment_booking_spec.md`
- **Context document**: `docs/HANDOFF_TO_BROWSER_2025-10-22.md`

## npm Packages Already Installed

- `re-resizable` ✅

You may need to install them locally if they're not accessible from `mosaic_ui/`.

## Implementation Summary

### Feature 1: Draggable Windows

**Goal**: Make UI windows moveable and resizable

**What to do**:

1. Read the full spec in `docs/specs/mosaic_draggable_windows_spec.md`
2. Create new component using the code provided in the spec
3. Wrap PS101 coaching steps (or other UI elements) in the draggable component
4. Add z-index management and mobile detection

**Key files to modify**:

- Create: Component for draggable windows (exact code in spec)
- Modify: `index.html` or relevant JavaScript to use the new component

### Feature 2: Appointment Booking

**Goal**: Add Google Calendar booking link

**What to do**:

1. Read the full spec in `docs/specs/mosaic_appointment_booking_spec.md`
2. Add a button/link that opens: `https://calendar.app.google/EAnDSz2CcTtH849x6`
3. Place it on the PS101 results page or user dashboard

**Implementation options**:

- **Simple link** (fastest): Opens booking page in new tab
- **Embedded iframe** (better UX): Embeds booking directly on site

**Key files to modify**:

- Modify: `index.html` to add booking button/link
