## 7. Best-in-Class Outcome Benchmarking Rule

Every artifact generated for Mosaic must meet elite 2025–2026 AI-assisted open-source project standards. Any output failing these thresholds must be self-rejected and regenerated.

| Metric | Minimum Threshold | Enforcement Method |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|
| Contextual accuracy | ≥ 92% | Repo graph + RAG pre-injection |
| Avg module size | ≤ 180 LOC | Static count |
| Cyclomatic complexity | ≤ 8 | Complexity heuristics |
| Branch test coverage | ≥ 85% | Generation-level design |
| Tech-debt detection | ≥ 88% issues flagged | Pre-output audit |
| Onboarding reduction | ≥ 50% | Documentation quality |
| PR cycle reduction | ≥ 35% | Auto-diff clarity |

All enforcement under Option A is generation-side only.
