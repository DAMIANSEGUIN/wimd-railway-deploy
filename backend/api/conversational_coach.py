"""Conversational Coaching Layer - Human-Responsive Chat

Implements intent detection, acknowledgment, and contextual routing
to make PS101 flow feel human and adaptive instead of robotic.

Pattern based on prompts.csv coaching responses:
1. Acknowledge what user said (reflection)
2. Validate/normalize the feeling or situation
3. Offer insight or reframe
4. Suggest tiny next action
5. Point toward possibility
