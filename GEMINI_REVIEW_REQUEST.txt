Gemini,

Claude Code has identified a critical issue: We're stuck in a loop.

**The Situation:**
- We have a huge index.html (4000+ lines, unmaintainable)
- Phase 1 modularization was attempted but broke production (Nov 21)
- It was reverted, but that means we're stuck with the huge file forever
- We can't fix the big file without completing Phase 1
- We can't deploy Phase 1 because it's incomplete (missing integration)

**Claude's Analysis:**
Phase 1 is 95% complete. Only missing 3 lines of integration code.
All modules work. Tests pass. Just need to call them from the IIFE.

**Proposal:**
Complete Phase 2 integration (add 3 lines), test locally, deploy together.
This breaks the loop and gives us a modular codebase.

**Alternative:**
Deploy the login fix first, deal with Phase 2 later (stays in the loop).

**Full Details:**
.ai-agents/PHASE1_COMPLETION_PROPOSAL_2025-11-25.md

**Decision Needed:**
Option A: Complete Phase 2 now (1-2 hour delay, solves loop)
Option B: Deploy login fix first, Phase 2 later (loop continues)

Please review the proposal and advise.
